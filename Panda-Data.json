    "Geographic Location": "West Africa: Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Côte D'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin",
    "Conservation Status": "Critical/Endangered",
    "About the Area": "This super ecoregion is made up of these terrestrial ecoregions.\n\nThe Western Guinean lowland forests that extend from Guinea and Sierra Leone through Liberia and southeastern Côte d'Ivoire as far as the Sassandra River;\n\nGuinean montane forests found at higher elevations in the highlands of central Guinea, northern Sierra Leone, and eastern Côte d'Ivoire; and\n\nThe Eastern Guinean forests that extend east from the Sassandra River through Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana to western Togo, with a few isolated enclaves further inland in the highlands of central Togo and Benin.\n\nThe Guinean moist forests are greatly influenced by the dry winds from the Sahara and the cool currents of the Atlantic, creating a climate that is more seasonal (including over 80 inches or 200 cm of rainfall!) than the Congolian forests of Central Africa.\n\n\n\nMany plants and animals found here are also found in the Congolian forests, revealing that these forests may have been connected in the past. Temperatures vary little, giving the region a perfect greenhouse climate.",
    "Local Species": "The diversity of life inhabiting these forests is nothing short of astonishing! Scientists have documented extraordinary diversity in some parts of this ecoregion. For example, in addition to over 2,000 species of vascular plants recorded, more than 500 new species have been discovered on Mt. Nimba, many of them endemic.\n\nSelected species include the Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), leopard (Panthera pardus), Cassin's hawk eagle (Spizaetus africanus), Pygmy hippopotamus (Hexaprotodon liberiensis), West African hinged tortoise (Kinixys erosa), Ogilby's duiker (Cephalophus ogilbyi), Mount Nimba otter shrew (Micropotamogale lamottei), and the Golden cat (Profelis aurata).\n\nBird species include endemics such as the Gola malimbe (Malimbus ballmanni), Black-capped rufous warbler (Bathmocercus cerviniventris), Little green woodpecker (Campethera maculosa), and the Rufous fishing-owl (Scotopelia ussheri).",
    "Featured Species": "The White-throated Guenon (Cercopithecus erythrogaster), also known as the Red-bellied Monkey and the Red-bellied Guenon, is a diurnal primate that lives on trees of rainforests or tropical areas of Nigeria and Benin.\n\nIt was once considered extinct due to constant hunting for the fur of its unique red belly and white front legs. Though a small group was found near the Niger River in 1988, this monkey is still endangered. Females giving birth to one offspring and man-made threats are two main factors responsible for its decreasing population. Today, its territory is protected and regarded as a holy land, where hunting and logging is restricted.",
    "Threats": "Agricultural expansion, hunting, commercial logging, and anthropogenic fires pose significant threats to the ecoregion."

It is widely believed that the areas surrounding Calabar and Cross River State contain the world's largest diversity of butterflies.\n\nThe coastal forests receive the highest rainfall in Africa - over 33 feet (10 m) per year, with warm to hot temperatures hovering within a narrow range.",
    "Local Species": "Mammal species include mandrill (Mandrillus leucophaeus), flightless scaly-tailed squirrel (Zenkerella insignis), long-tailed pangolin (Manis tetradactyla), black colobus monkey (Colobus satanas), northern needle-clawed bushbaby (Euoticus pallidus), and sun-tailed monkey (Cercopithecus solatus).\n\nOther species include Goliath frog (Conraua goliath), and numerous endemic birds like Bates's weaver (Ploceus batesi), Gabon batis (Batis minima), Giant sunbird (Nectarinia thomensis), Dohrn's thrush-babbler (Horizorhinus dohrni), Dwarf olive ibis (Bostrychiabocagei), and São Tomé grosbeak (Neospiza concolor).\n\nGiant ginger (Aframomum giganteum), the tallest species of ginger in the world and a favoured food of the lowland gorilla, is also native to this ecoregion. Another notable plant is the Dioscorea, a native yam that is a staple crop for many local people. The moist environment is also suitable for small trees that produce cola-fruits, a popular food for primates, squirrels, and humans.",
    "Featured Species": "The Goliath frog (Conraua goliath), an African frog of genus Conraua, can grow up to 13 inches in length from head to vent, and weighs up to 7 lb. It is the largest frog on Earth and is renowned for its incredible leaping ability, jumping up to 10 feet in one bound. However, it is usually exhausted after 2 or 3 such leaps. \n\nThis animal has a relatively small habitat range, mainly in West Africa. Its numbers are dwindling due to habitat destruction and collection for the pet trade. It is large enough to swallow a duck and can live up to the age of 15 years.\n\nIt is normally found in fast flowing rivers with sandy bottoms in the West African countries of Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea. Due to their classification as 'endangered', the Equatorial Guinean government has declared that no more than 300 Goliaths may be exported out of the country per year. Fortunately for the frogs, even the most experienced of animal collectors can usually find no more than a dozen per trip.",

    "Geographic Location": "Western Africa: Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria",
    "Conservation Status": "Critical/Endangered",
    "About the Area": "This ecoregion encompasses the mountains and highland areas of the border region between Nigeria and Cameroon. Most of the ecoregion lies within a narrow rectangle of 180 km by 625 km, oriented southwest to northeast and originating about 50 km inland of Mount Cameroon.It covers the Rumpi Hills, the Bakossi Mountains, Mount Nlonako, Mount Kupe and Mount Manengouba. Mt. Cameroon is an active volcano that sits near the coast and rises from this mountain range, but is considered a separate ecoregion from the older, non-volcanic Cameroonian Highlands Forests.\n\nAt 3,011 m, Mount Oku is the highest peak in this ecoregion. The remainder could be anywhere between 800-2,600 m in elevation. In the majority of cases, however, the lower boundary of these forests is now determined by conversion to agricultural land. \n\nMean maximum temperatures are below 20°C due to the effects of altitude. Areas close to the coast experience rainfall of around 4,000 mm per annum while those inland get 1,800 mm or less.\n\nFertile soil (a legacy of the volcanic past) combined with adequate rainfall makes the region ideally suited for agricultural use thus contributing to a high human population density. However, once cleared of protective forests, these soils turn dry, making them barren and useless for agriculture.",
    "Local Species": "The Cameroonian Highlands Forests ecoregion occurs in patches at various altitudes on mountaintops and ridges. Hence, even the native plants and animal species are distributed in certain habitats or between narrow altitudinal bands with more endemic species inhabiting the larger, more isolated patches.\n\nAt least 50 species and 3 families of plants are strictly endemic and 50 more are near endemic to Mt. Cameroon and associated lowland forests. Many of these endemic plant species reflect a recent evolutionary history, developing unique characteristics and adaptations in relation to the emergence of Mount Cameroon. In Mount Kupe is present a wild coffee plant which believed to be of more value than the robusta and arabica coffee species common in Cameroon.\n\nAmong the numerous endemic species are birds such as Green longtail (Urolais epichlora), White-tailed warbler (Poliolais lopezi), Mount Cameroon francolin (Francolinus camerunensis), Fernando Po speirops (Batis poensis), Bannerman's turaco (Tauraco bannermani); reptiles such as Chamaeleo montium, Chamaeleo quadricornis, Hydraethiops laevis, Leptosiaphos ianthinoxantha; and mammals such as Preuss's monkey (Cercopithecus preussi), and Northern needle-clawed bushbaby (Euoticus pallidus).\n\nVery high levels of endemism are observed among amphibians, with nearly 40 species as strict endemics.",
    "Featured Species": 0,
    "Threats": "Forest loss caused by unsustainable exploitation of firewood, overgrazing, fire damage and agricultural encroachment is the main threat to this ecoregion. Hunting also threatens the remaining larger mammals. This is one of the least well-protected ecoregions in Africa. No part of this ecoregion is under formal protected status in Cameroon, although local traditional rulers still exert considerable authority over land use.\n\nThe main section of Bakossi (550 km²) has been proposed as \"Protection Forest\", banning all logging. Kupe has been proposed as a \"Strict Nature Reserve\", while the forest at Oku has some form of protection and the boundaries are well demarcated."

    "About the Area": "The Northeastern Congo Basin Moist Forests are located in the northeastern portion of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) extending into the Southeastern portion of the Central African Republic (CAR).\n\nPart of an ancient drainage basin influenced by climate desiccation events during recent Ice Ages, the lowland forests of this ecoregion contain a rich assortment of endemic species. The ecoregion lies within the humid tropics with rainfall averaging between 1,500 mm and 2,000 mm per annum.\n\nThe Ituri forests are of particular significance because they are home of the Mbuti pygmies, one of the hunter-gatherer peoples living in equatorial rainforests characterized by their short height (below 1.5 m, or 59 inches, on average). Also worth mentioning are the lowland forests of the Itombwe Mountains to the South",
    "Local Species": "The ecoregion is home to a diverse array of mammals, including such species as L'hoest i'sguenon (Cercopitheus l'hoesti), Gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), Angolan black-and-white colobus (Colobus angolensis), Okapi (Okapia johnstoni), and Brush-tailed porcupines (Atherurus africanus).\n\nEndemic mammals include Piliocolobus oustaleti, Dent's guenon (Cercopithecus monadenti), Aquatic genet (Osbornictis piscivora), and Giant forest genet (Genetta victoriae).\n\nTwo birds - Bedford's paradise flycatcher (Terpsiphone bedfordi) and Turner's eremomela (Eremomelaturneri) are restricted to these forests. More characteristic species include the Lesser striped-swallow (Hirundo abyssinica) and Green-backed woodpecker (Campethera cailliauti).\n\nThe flora is diverse and has high levels of endemism. Around 1500 species of plants are known from the Ituri forests alone.",
    "Featured Species": "The Aquatic Genet (Osbornictis piscivora ) is a carnivore mammal from northeast Zaire, related to civets and linsangs. Unlike other genets, which have handsomely spotted coats and ringed tails, the Aquatic Genet has a plain, rusty-colored coat, and a black tail, with white spots behind its eyes. It feeds primarily on fish, which it attracts by tapping the surface of the water of rainforest streams. Its paws are hairless, an adaptation for catching fish. Despite its diet, and common name, it is not a good swimmer.\n\nLike most members of its family, it is a secretive and rarely seen species, and little is known about its behavior in the wild.",
    "Threats": "Hunting of animals for food and for medicinal values increasingly threatens ecosystem dynamics. Conversion of forest for agriculture and mining for gold constitute other threats. Mining has already seriously impacted many important forest areas, such as Ituri and the Kahuzi Biega lowlands (in the latter there are close to 15,000 miners). Political unrest in the region has led to widespread migrations of refugees which has triggered large-scale clearing of forest areas for subsistence agriculture\n\nIn the central part of the ecoregion there are lesser threats, since there are fewer people and those that live there (mainly pygmies), support themselves in ways that preserve the forest vegetation."

Erosion over thousands of years has helped to shape the region's topography. The name \"Congo\" (meaning \"hunter\") is coined after the Bakongo ethnic group, living in the Congo river basin.\n\nThe central part of the Congo River Basin and the foothills of the mountain range that borders the Albertine Rift receive a lot of rainfall (2,000-3,000 mm/year). A critical feature of the Congo River Basin forests is that they generate between 75% and 95% of their own rainfall - the remainder originates from outside the basin.\n\nAlthough swamp and primary forests dominate, there is a mix of vegetation types, including swamp forests, seasonally flooded forests, lowland rain forests, and forest-grassland mosaics.",

The giant pangolin has the largest concentrations in Uganda, Tanzania, and western Kenya. It is found mainly in the savannas, rainforests, and forests, inhabiting areas with large termite populations and available water. Giant pangolins do not inhabit high-altitude areas.\n\nThe species has large, armored scales and no hair except for the eyelashes. Giant pangolins have long snouts, a long and thick tail, large front claws, and a strong sense of smell. By using its tail for balance, giant pangolins will often walk upright as a biped!\n\nFactors such as habitat destruction, deforestation, and bushmeat hunting have caused a significant decline in the species’ numbers.",
    "Threats": "Thick vegetation, high water, and hordes of mosquitoes meant until recently, the region was sparsely populated and relatively intact. However, there are no protected areas within the ecoregion and whatever little area, that has been converted generally occurs along rivers that serve to be the only means of access.\n\nOver the past century or so, the DRC has developed into the center of what has been called the Central African \"bushmeat\" problem, which is regarded by many as a major environmental, as well as, socio-economic crisis. \"Bushmeat\" is another word for the meat of wild animals. It is typically obtained through trapping, usually with wire snares, or otherwise with shotguns or arms originally intended for use in the DRC's numerous military conflicts."

Males can reach as much as 2 m in length and 110 centimeters high at the shoulder and have been known to weigh as much as 225 kg.\n\nIt is mostly black in color on the surface, though hairs nearest the skin of the animal are a deep orange color. Its ears are large and pointy, and its tusks are much smaller than those of the warthog or bushpig. This nocturnal species is herbivorous and does not dig for food with its snout like other wild pigs do.\n\nThough known to native peoples of tropical African forests for many millennia and subject in many of these cultures to various taboos and superstitions, giant forest hogs were not known to Western science until 1904.",
    "Threats": "While the forests of this ecoregion are relatively intact, increasing logging activity and clearing for agriculture threaten them. Ravaged by commercial interests (Ivory, skins, rubber and slaves) for about 100 years, the indigenous people have been deeply affected by these events. Organized hunting of the larger species for bushmeat, elephants for ivory and meat, and gorillas for meat and fetishes threatens animal populations in the region. Closer to the Congo and Ubangui Rivers, poaching has probably already eliminated elephants."

    "Local Species": "This ecoregion is an area of exceptional faunal and moderate floral endemism. There is all sorts of life to amaze you like the 14 species of butterflies (including the vulnerable cream-banded swallowtail butterfly) and 37 species of birds including the Rwenzori batis (Batis diops), Chapin's flycatcher (Muscicapa lendu), Collared apalis (Apalis ruwenzorii), Grauer's warbler (Graueria vittata), Albertine owlet (Glaucidium albertinum) - the highest figure in Africa for any equivalent-sized area, found nowhere else in the world. \n\nBwindi Forest in Uganda supports an estimated 1000 plant species; eight of these are tree species only found locally.

It has pale yellow eyes and a spotted belly. This bird is found in very open montane and transitional forest, with many clearings and a dense understorey, and probably occurs up to 2,500 m at least. Its diet mostly consists of invertebrates, and its breeding ecology is unknown.\n\nThe Albertine Owlet classified as Vulnerable because it is inferred to have a very small population that is severely fragmented and probably declining, given the continuing clearance and degradation of its forest habitat.",
    "Threats": "Throughout much of the ecoregion, especially in Burundi and Rwanda, the rural human population density is amongst the highest in Africa. This places considerable pressure on the remaining forest resources as most families live on subsistence farming.\n\nHighland forests have been largely cleared but some sizable blocks of montane forest still occur in areas such as the Virunga, Itombwe, and Rwenzori Ranges. The farming activities of rural people are destroying and fragmenting habitats of this ecoregion in many areas, and this issue is the largest and most overriding concern for conservation in the area.\n\nAnother threat to the region is hunting and poaching, which is causing major problems in several protected areas and is even more intense outside these areas. Furthermore, wars and political unrest prevent the effective management of some protected areas in the ecoregion, thereby further increasing problems of encroachment and illegal activities, such as the killing of mountain gorillas.\n\nPopulations of elephant (Loxodonta africana), as well as many other large mammal species, have been decimated during the regions turbulent political past.

It stretches from Southern Somalia through Kenya and Tanzania, to Southern Mozambique, and is characterized by tropical dry forests within a mosaic of savannas, grassland habitats and wetlands areas. Generally, the forests are found just inland from the coast with outliers occurring along rivers and several locations where it grades into sub-montane forests at the foothills of mountain ranges.\n\nAreas between the forests have different characteristics depending on the country in question; in Kenya it is mainly farmland, in Tanzania and Mozambique it is generally savanna woodland/thicket with farmed areas increasing. The ecoregion also includes the larger offshore islands of Pemba, Zanzibar, Mafia and the Bazaruto Archipelago, as well as the smaller isles in the Indian Ocean close to the coast",
    "Local Species": "As the East African Coastal Forests have long been isolated from other regions of tropical moist forests by expanses of drier savannas and grasslands, it has an exceptionally high level of plant endemism that has recently led to part of it being classified as the Swahili Centre of endemism. Elsewhere within the region (Somalia and Mozambique), studies at a few sites have also noted the occurrence of endemic trees, but overall the number of endemic species is thought to be greatly underestimated due to civil strife that has prevented further exploration.\n\nAmong the best-known plants in the ecoregion are the species of African violets (Saintpaulia spp.). The 40,000 cultivated varieties of the African violet, which form the basis of a US$100 million/year house plant trade globally, are all derived from just 3 species found in coastal Tanzanian and Kenyan forests. Also found here are 11 species of wild coffee, 8 of which are endemic.\n\nThe East African Coastal Forests are a bird-lover's paradise what with more than 633 bird species found here; 11 of which are endemic. Among them are the Clarke's weaver (Ploceus golandi), Sokoke scops owl (Otus ireneae), Pemba sunbird (Nectarina pemba), Fischer's tauraco (Tauraco fishceri), and the Tana River cisticola (Cisticola restrictus). \n\nThe forests also have their share of mammals including the Pemba Island flying fox (Pteropus comorensis), Sokoke dog mongoose (Bdeogale omnivora), Zanzibar red colobus (Piliocolobus kirkii), Tana mangabey (Cercocebus galeritus), and the Zanj elephant shrew (Rhynchocyon petersi).\n\nThis ecoregion is home to a variety of primate species including 3 endemic and highly threatened monkey species and 2 endemic species of bushbabies.",
    "Featured Species": "Pemba sunbird\n\nThe sunbirds are very small passerine birds which feed largely on nectar, although they will also take insects, especially when feeding young. Flight is fast and direct on their short wings. Although they are completely unrelated, the sunbirds find counterparts in the hummingbirds of the Americas and the honeyeaters of Australia. The resemblances are due to convergent evolution due to the similar nectar-feeding lifestyle.\n\nThe sunbirds are tropical species, with representatives from Africa to Australasia; however, the greatest variety of species is in Africa where the group probably arose.\n\nLike the hummingbirds, they are strongly sexually dimorphic, with the males usually brilliantly plumaged in metallic colours. Sunbirds have long thin down-curved bills and brush tipped tubular tongues, both adaptations to their nectar feeding. Up to 3 eggs are laid in a purse-shaped suspended nest.",
    "Threats": "Most of this area has been heavily settled for many years and only a few blocks of lingering forest remain widely distributed and isolated throughout the ecoregion. Looking for wood to fuel their fires and space to grow their crops, local people have cleared much of the region's forests. Agricultural expansion continues to be the biggest threat facing the Coastal Forests of East Africa. Due to poor soil quality and an increasing population trend, subsistence agriculture as well as commercial farming continue to consume more and more of the region's natural habitat"

Some species are subterranean; many are nocturnal.\n\nDuring the day, they may hide under logs, bark, stones, or leaves and prefer a humid environment. Amblypygids may range from 5 to 40 mm. Their bodies are broad and highly flattened. Their very thin modified legs can extend several times the length of body. They have no silk glands or poisonous fangs, but can have prominent pincer-like pedipalps.\n\nAmblypygids often move about sideways on their 6 walking legs, with one \"whip\" pointed in the direction of travel while the other probes on either side of them. Prey are located with these \"whips\", captured with pedipalps, and then torn to pieces with chelicerae.",
    "Threats": "Few of the mountains have protected status, the rest threatened by agricultural expansion on lower slopes, firewood collection, and grazing. In some cases, there is significant commercial logging (mainly using pit-sawing techniques), and in other areas there is encroachment for farm plots and for the collection of other wood products for firewood and poles."

    "Name": "Madagascar Forests and Shrublands",
    "Size": "313,000 sq. km (121,000 sq. miles)",
    "Habitat Type": "Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests",
    "Geographic Location": "Eastern and northern Madagascar",
    "Conservation Status": "Critical/Endangered",
    "About the Area": "Due to long isolation from major landmasses, and the influence of geography and climate, the biodiversity of Madagascar is extremely rich and diverse across relatively small areas. The island-continent has evolved remarkably diverse ecosystems including lush tropical rain forests, mountain peaks, tropical dry forests, near-desert environments, mangrove forests, and coral reefs - each supporting a stunning array of unique species.\n\nIt is estimated that 85% of the island’s 12,000 species of flowering plants are found nowhere else in the world. This unique biodiversity has led to the recognition of Madagascar as a \"living laboratory\" and the \"seventh continent\".\n\nThis Global ecoregion is made up of these terrestrial ecoregions: Madagascar subhumid forests; Madagascar ericoid thickets; Madagascar lowland forests.\n\nThe Madagascar Subhumid Forests are scattered in several \"islands\" of montane humid forest throughout the central highlands of Madagascar. The lowland forests of Madagascar include a narrow strip of humid forests along the east coast, low elevation forests.\n\nThe Madagascar ericoid thickets are 4 large mountainous formations, called massifs that rise in scattered points from the island of Madagascar. The name of the ecoregion is based on its principal species of vegetation - thicket-forming plants of the Ericaceae (blueberry) family.",
    "Local Species": "Filled with flowering trees, fast-growing vines, flowers, and tree ferns, the forests are a feast for the senses and a storehouse of wondrous diversity.\n\nAll 50 known species of the small primates known as lemurs, are found only on this island. These include:\nThe indri (Indri indri), the largest living lemur, which has a black fur with white patches.\nBlack lemurs that feed on ripe fruit, leaves, insects, and flowers.\nThe recently rediscovered hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus trichotis) that has long wavy hair around its ears.\nOther significant species include Tomato frogs (Dyscophus antongili), Leaf-tailed geckos (Uroplatus fimbriatus), Velvet asity, the Madagascar yellowbrows (Crossleyia xanthophrys), and the critically endangered Golden Bamboo Lemur (Hapalemur aureus). These forests are also home to some of the rarest birds in the world like the Madagascar serpent eagle (Eutriochis astur) and the Madagascar red owl (Tyto soumagne).",
    "Featured Species": "The Tomato Frogs (Dyscophus antongili) occur on the east coast of Madagascar, which is subjected to rainfall throughout the year and constant temperatures of 25-30°C. They occur amongst a range of vegetation on the forest floor, but usually close to or in shallow water. Females reach 105mm in length, whilst males rarely exceed 65mm.\n\nThe back is orange-red and the ventral surface yellowish, sometimes with black spots on the throat. The Tomato Frog is a sedentary species, rarely moving far from preferred sites in the forest or close to shallow pools.\n\nIt does not climb and is not a good swimmer, preferring to walk or slowly hop. During any lengthy dry periods, these frogs will tend to burrow into loose surface soil and leaf litter, emerging after rain.",
    "Threats": "The principle threats to Madagascar's biodiversity come from the small-scale but widespread clearing of forests associated with slash-and-burn agriculture and firewood collection. Villagers rely on many forest resources to meet their basic needs; the trade in reptiles and amphibians is also depleting wild populations.\n\nSince the arrival of humans 2,000 years ago, Madagascar has lost more than 90%of its original forest cover and many of its endemic species. For example, the world’s largest flightless bird, the 10-foot-tall \"elephant bird\" Aepyornis, once lived in this ecoregion, as did the pygmy hippopotamus, the giant tortoise, and 16 additional species of lemur, including a giant ground-dwelling species.\n\nEven now, virtually all the unique habitats and endemic animals of Madagascar face significant threats. It now has the greatest number of critically endangered primates of any country in the world."

The Seychelles are made up of 115 islands that can be divided into 2 types: the 42 granitic islands that make up this ecoregion, and low limestone islands.\n\nThe Seychelles Islands are justly famous for their coral reefs and the remote Aldabra Atoll - the largest raised atoll in the world. It supports a huge coral diversity and rare land species like the giant tortoise (Aldabrachelys elephantina), vast seabird colonies and important sea turtle breeding beaches. In recognition of its status it is listed as a natural World Heritage site by UNESCO.\n\nThe Mascarene forests include the Réunion Islands, Rodrigues Island and Mauritius that were once home to the now extinct Dodo. The Aldabra Islands are also called the Galapagos of the Indian Ocean with most of its surface being the remains of an ancient coral reef. \n\nAll the islands experience a humid tropical climate with monsoon rains from November to April.",
    "Local Species": "In Seychelles, species include legless caecilians (a wormlike amphibian), Seychelles paradise flycatchers, Seychelles magpie-robins (Copsychus sechellarum), Seychelles sheath-tailed bat (Coleura seychellensis), Seychelles kestrel (Falco araea), Seychelles swiflet (Collocalia elaphra), Seychelles wild vanilla orchid, stilt palm, Seychelles pitcher plant, and one of the rarest plants in the world, the jellyfish tree - with a total population of less than 30, it was thought to be extinct until rediscovered in 1970. The forests of the Seychelles are also home to the extraordinary Coco de Mer palm (Lodoicea maldivica), with the world's largest nut - coco-de-mer, or sea coconut that weighs in at about 22.5 kilograms!\n\nOn Réunion, species include Réunion cuckoo-shrike (Coracina newtoni), Réunion stone chat (Saxicola tectes), and Olivaceous bulbul (Hypsipetes borbonicus). On Mauritius the Mauritius kestrel (Falco punctatus) has been successfully bred in captivity for reintroduction, and the pink pigeon (Columba mayeri) is also found there. Unique reptiles and amphibians include the endemic frog family, Sooglossidae.\n\nWith about 152,000 individuals, Aldabra has the largest population of these giant tortoises (Dipsochelus gigantea) in the world. This ecoregion is also home to the very last known population of flightless birds in the western Indian Ocean, and it provides valuable breeding areas for both marine turtles and seabirds. Also found here are the plump Aldabra white-throated rails, the last living representative of several species of Indian Ocean flightless birds.",
    "Featured Species": "The Aldabra Giant Tortoise (Geochelone gigantea), from the islands of the Aldabra Atoll in the Seychelles, is one of the largest tortoises in the world. The shell is a dark gray or black color with a high domed shape. It has stocky, heavily scaled legs to support its heavy body.\n\nPrimarily herbivores, Aldabra Tortoises will eat grasses, leaves, and woody plant stems. They occasionally indulge in small invertebrates and carrion, even eating the bodies of other dead tortoises. They are also excellent swimmers, being neutrally buoyant. These Large tortoises are among the longest-lived animals on the planet. Some individual Aldabra Giant Tortoises are thought to be over 100 years of age, but this is difficult to verify because they tend to outlive their human observers.",
    "Threats": "In addition to extensive clearing of native forests for agriculture and development, particularly in the lowlands, the natural communities of the islands are seriously threatened by introduced animals such as goats, pigs, and cattle. Introduced cats, dogs, and mongoose prey on native species, particularly seabirds, lizards, caecilians, and invertebrates. Cyclones also hammer the degraded landscape, causing landslides and giving alien plants a foothold from which to further invade native habitats. \n\nThe Seychelles suffered a severe coral bleaching event in the late 1990s and a recent assessment by the Seychelles Foundation judged climate change to be the most significant threat facing the Aldabra atoll."

    "About the Area": "This global ecoregion is made up of 2 terrestrial ecoregions: Sulawesi lowland rain forests; and Sulawesi montane rain forests.\n\nThe Sulawasi lowlands are mainly tropical lowland evergreen and semi-evergreen rainforests, with monsoon forests at the tip of the southeast peninsula and small areas of freshwater and peat swamp forest. They are dominated by 7 species of dipterocarp trees, but also boast palms and ebonies in dense clumps. The Sulawesi montane rain forests, located in the region known as Wallacea, are dominated by oaks and chestnuts.\n\nMany of Sulawesi's species can trace their ancestry to the continents of Asia and Australia. However, its geologic history, and long geographic isolation have given the island its own distinctive fauna. This ecoregion exhibits high plant endemism, and several distinct forest types provide habitat for the highest number of endemic mammals in Asia and numerous endemic birds.",
    "Local Species": "Endemic mammal species include the endangered mountain anoa (Bubalus quarlesi), crested macaque (Macaca nigra), vulnerable babirusa (Babyrousa babyrussa), and the Sulawesi montane long-nosed squirrel (Hyosciurus heinrichi)\n\nAlso found here and nowhere else are Sulawesi barebacked fruit bat (Dobsonia exoleta), Sulawesi tarsier (Tarsius spectrum), short-tailed Talaud melomys (Melomys caurinus), and Sulawesian palm civet (Macrogalidia musschenbroekii).

    "Featured Species": "These lizards have a small head with a long snout and oval nostrils near the tip of the snout. On the head and snout there is a crest of mostly large scales. The body is cylindrical and compressed; the back has a large spine covered with small scales.\n\nThe Sailfin lizard’s unique characteristic is its tail, which is twice the length of the head and body put together! The tail starts off thick and round at the base, towards the tip, it becomes flatter, helping the lizard swim. Sailfin lizards grow to over 90 cm (3 ft). These strong built lizards are dark greenish-brown with black spots, and feed mostly on plants and sometimes insects, rodents and millipedes.",
    "Threats": "While many of Indonesia's larger islands suffer from deforestation, Sulawesi still supports extensive tracts of both mountain and lowland moist forests. The island's steep slopes, and the relative lack of commercially valuable tree species, help contribute to the still extensive forests that cover over 60% of the island.\n\nHowever, the logging that has occurred has had devastating effects on the landscape and the ecosystems. For example, extensive erosion on surrounding deforested slopes has clogged the irrigation systems of the once fertile rice fields of Palu Valley. Hunting and anthropogenic fires are also serious threats to the wildlife and habitat."

Also known as the Spice Islands, they have luxuriant vegetation including rainforests, sago, rice, and the famous spices - nutmeg, cloves and mace, among others.\n\nThis global ecoregion is made up of 2 terrestrial ecoregions: Seram rain forests; and Halmahera rain forests. Seram is one of the most distinctive islands in the Moluccas island chain with 16 of over 200 bird species endemic. It also is home to the Moluccas’ largest bird, the two-wattled cassowary. The Halmahera rain forests also have a high number of endemic species, with 6 of its 38 mammal species endemic, including the Bisa rat, masked flying fox, and 3 species of cuscus.",

The female is about 39 mm long, has a wingspan of 63 mm, a massive 3 mm wide head, and enormous pointed jaws. She is covered with velvety black fur but has a band of white fur on the front part of her abdomen. The male looks puny beside the female and is only 23 mm long.\n\nThe female bee collects bundles of wood fibres for nest building and carries them back to her nest in her jaws. She constructs tunnels and cells by mixing the wood particles with resin. The mixture hardens into a black waterproof material that seals the termites out of the bee’s nest.",
    "Threats": "Indonesia's population is doubling every 30 years. The population increase is leading to exponential increases in natural resource demands. Threats to the ecoregion include logging, tapping of damar trees, and illegal collection of plants and animals. The local commercial wildlife trade, which targets parrots in particular, poses another risk to Seram’s biodiversity. In Halmahera, the eastern forests are threatened by pulp plantations, especially using local transmigrants"

Whilst all bats possess wings formed from a double membrane stretched between the elongated fingers, the evening bats also have a membrane stretched between their ankles and nearly enclosing the tail, known as the interfemoral membrane.\n\nThis membrane is unusually furry in the brown tube-nosed bat. Whilst this species finds its insect prey using echolocation, its ears are small for its size. As the brown tube-nosed bat holds its mouth open much of the time in order to echolocate, it is easy to see its large, sharp teeth, used to crush hard-bodied insects.",
    "Threats": "Logging concessions that overlap with protected areas are a major threat. Road construction, shifting cultivation, agricultural expansion, and plantation development all constitute additional threats.\n\nHunting is a problem for some species, especially the western crowned pigeon (Goura cristata), northern cassowary (Casuarius unappendiculatus), Nicobar pigeon (Caloena nicobarica), and the Raggiana bird of paradise."

    "Conservation Status": "Critical/Endangered",
    "About the Area": "New Caledonia is an isolated remnant of the ancient super continent Gondwana. This history, combined with the presence of unusual serpentine soils and climate variation resulting from its topography, has helped produce one of the world's most extraordinary and rich biotas, despite its small size.\nThe region has very high endemism in plant and animal species, with an impressive diversity of vegetation types - over 2,900 species of vascular plants, of which nearly 80 per cent are endemic.\n\nBecause the island is separated from Australia by a wide stretch of ocean, these species haven't spread to other areas but have evolved in isolation over millions of years.",
    "Local Species": "There is a high degree of endemism in arthropods, reptiles, birds, and plants including the Kagu (Rhynochetus jubata) - the sole member of an endemic bird family, two species of giant gecko, as well as the unique plants Araucaria rulei and Dacyridium guillauminii.\n\nThe flora is incredibly rich, supporting a diverse array of conifers: araucariads and podocarps. Angiosperms include a number of endemic families, such as Amborella, Canacomyrica, Paracryphia, and Strasburgeria.",

    "About the Area": "This Global ecoregion is made up of 2 terrestrial ecoregions: Lord Howe Island subtropical forests; and Norfolk Island subtropical forests.\n\nLord Howe Island is a crescent-shaped remnant of a volcano that formed almost 7 million years ago. These ancient and isolated islands support at least 392 distinctive species, of which 40% are found only here.\n\nHabitats include subtropical broadleaf, palm, and conifer forests. Norfolk Island has 174 native plant species, and 51 are endemic. This includes the smooth tree-fern which is the tallest tree-fern in the world, reaching heights of 20 m (65 ft).\n\nThe climate is humid-subtropical, with a mean annual rainfall of 1,717 -1,357 mm.",
    "Local Species": "The flora and fauna of Lord Howe Island show a high degree of endemism. Of the 241 native species of vascular plants, 105 are endemic species. There are 5 endemic plant genera: Negria, Lordhowea, and the palms Hedyscepe, Howea, and Lepidorrhachis.\n\nThere are 129 native and introduced bird species on the islands, 27 of which breed regularly on Lord Howe. The endemic bird species include the endangered Lord Howe Island wood rail (Tricholimas sylvestris), Lord Howe rail (Gallirallus sylvestris), and Lord Howe white-eye (Zosterops tephropleurus) as well as subspecies of golden whistler, silvereye, and pied currawong. In addition, numerous seabirds are found here. The island is home to half the world's population of flesh-footed shearwaters and the greatest concentration of red-tailed tropic birds.\n\nEndemic to Norfolk Island are Norfolk Island parakeet (Cyanoramphus cookii), and Slender-billed white-eye (Zosterops tenuirostris). Other birds of interest include green parrot (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae), morepork (Ninox novaeseelandiae), and sacred kingfisher (Halcyon sancta).\n\nNorfolk Island has 174 native plant species, of which 51 are endemic Among the native trees found in the forests on Norfolk Island are Norfolk Island pine (Araucaria heterophylla), pepper tree (Macropiper excelsum), Bloodwood (Baloghia inophylla), and white oak (Lagunaria patersonia).\n\nThe only native mammal on the islands is Gould's wattled bat (Chalinolobus gouldii) which is locally very rare or possibly even extinct.",
    "Featured Species": "The Norfolk Island Palm (Rhopalostylis baueri) is prominent along gullies in or near the national park, but rare elsewhere on the island. It reaches 10 m in height. Fruits are an attractive bright red when ripe and are a favorite food of the green parrot. The growing tip of the Norfolk Island Palm was used by early settlers as a vegetable, reportedly tasting of nuts when raw and artichoke and cooked. It didn't agree with everybody – at least one convict is recorded as having died after overeating this palm ‘cabbage’. Removal of the tip kills the palm. Ribs from the palm fronds were used for making brooms, and the fronds woven into baskets",
    "Threats": "Introduced plants and animals, and grazing are the major threats. Introduced predators have had a devastating effect of the endemic land fauna, and introduced weeds are invading the islands and displacing native species. Continued control of existing exotics is an integral step in promoting the recovery of Lord Howe-Norfolk Islands forests’ many threatened species."

    "About the Area": "This Global ecoregion is made up of 2 terrestrial ecoregions: South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests; South Western Ghats montane rain forests.\n\nThe Southwestern Ghats occupy just 5% of India's land area, but they contain a large proportion of the country's plant and animal species. The country’s largest elephant population is found in the expanse of grasslands interspersed with stunted forests known locally as shola forests.\n\nMore than 4,000 species of flowering plants grow here, which is more than 25% of all the flowering plant species in the country.\n\nOf the 112 amphibian species unique to India, 84 are found here. One reason for this abundance of life is the region's exceptionally high rainfall",
    "Local Species": "The levels of endemism in these forests are truly astounding. Many creatures, including the lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus) and the endangered goat-antelope - Nilgiri tahr (Hemitragus hylocrius), are found only in these mountains and nowhere else on Earth.\n\nAlso found here are the Malabar civet (Viverra civettina), sloth bear (Ursus ursinus), tiger (Panthera tigris), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus).\n\nThe endemic bird species of the region include the Malabar parakeet (Psittacula columboides), Malabar grey-hornbill (Ocyceros griseus), Nilgiri pipit (Anthus nilghiriensis), and the Nilgiri flycatcher (Eumyias albicaudata).\n\nThe majority of the 50 endemic plant genera are monotypic (consisting of only one type). Among the unusual trees are 13 species of dipterocarps - large, commercially and ecologically valuable tropical hardwood trees.\n\nAbout 90 of India's 484 reptile species are endemic to these forests, including 8 endemic genera (Brachyophidium, Dravidogecko, Melanophidium, Plectrurus, Ristella, Salea, Teretrurus, and Xylophis). \n\nThe amphibian fauna exhibits even greater levels of endemism: almost 50% of India's 206 amphibian species are endemic to this ecoregion, among which are 6 endemic genera (Indotyphlus, Melanobatrachus, Nannobatrachus, Nyctibatrachus, Ranixalus, and Uraeotyphlus).",
    "Featured Species": "Dipterocarp means ‘2-winged seed’ in Greek. This describes their seeds well, although some have more than 2 wings.\n\nAveraging 40 m in height, dipterocarps form characteristic cauliflower crowns towering over the canopy, and most species have similar looking leaves. Dipterocarps are favorite timber trees because their wood is very hard (they are often called tropical hard woods) and they grow straight and tall without any lower branches. Dipterocarps are self-pruning, and only spread out when they emerge from the canopy. They are also light and float easily down rivers. Dipterocarps include timber trees like meranti (Shorea acuminata) and chengal (Neobalanocarpus heimii)",
    "Threats": "India has the second largest human population in the world after China, and the quest for space and natural resources has led to increasing pressures on the Southwestern Ghats Moist Forests. Logging, agriculture, hydroelectric projects, livestock grazing, mining, road construction, and tourism and urban expansion are all taking a toll on the health of the region's natural communities."

An endemic ground orchid, Anoectochilus setaceus, commonly known as the king of the forest or wanaraja, is found only in undisturbed portions of these rain forests.",
    "Featured Species": "The leopard (Panthera pardus) is the smallest of the great cats (lion, tiger, jaguar, and leopard). However, it is the most agile climber of the great cats, and is capable of killing prey far larger than itself. The leopard ranges in size from 1 - 2 m long, and weighs between 30 and 70 kg. Females are typically around two-thirds the size of males.\n\nIt has an elongated body set on relatively short and stocky legs. The paws are broad. Its ears are short and rounded. They have a very short and sleek coat. Color varies from light tawny to deep rusty yellow, with a lighter underside. They have dark spots on their face, head, throat, chest, and legs. The rest of their body is covered in rosettes. They can also be totally black.\n\nThe leopard’s diet consists of monkeys, rodents, reptiles, amphibians, birds, fish, wild pigs, and ungulates. Leopards are capable of carrying animals up to twice their own weight into the trees. They are solitary, nocturnal, and secretive cats.",
    "Threats": "Rice paddies, housing, and plantations of tea, rubber, and coconut have replaced most of the natural forests. The remnants in the southern lowlands and the montane habitats protected in the Sinharaja Natural Heritage Wilderness Area are globally significant for their biodiversity."

    "Featured Species": "The sun bear (Ursus malayanus) is the smallest living bear species in the world. It gets its name from the yellowish crescent shape on its chest. Males are 20% larger than the females. The adults only weigh up to 65kg, and are just 1.1-1.4 m tall (3.5-4.5 ft). They have a very short, dense black coat and long curved claws which help them climb trees.\n\nThe sun bear is an elusive nocturnal omnivore which lives in hardwood lowland forests. It spends much of its time in trees, even making a nest in branches. Land clearance for agriculture and logging has reduced the habitat of the sun bear, leading to its current endangered status.",
    "Threats": "The threats to biodiversity in this ecoregion stem from 2 main sources: land clearing for shifting cultivation, poppy cultivation, tourism, logging, and hunting for food and income. Almost all of the ecoregion forests that occur in Vietnam have been cleared for agricultural expansion.\n\nExtensive illegal hunting poses the greatest danger to this ecoregion's biodiversity. In its supply of a thriving Chinese market, hunting is indiscriminate, targeting all species, from large mammals to small birds, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates."

It enjoys a tropical monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 22oC. Precipitation patterns vary across the length of Taiwan, China. Because the island of Taiwan (China) is located near the border of 2 biological realms - the Palaearctic and Indomalayan, its forests support many tropical species at the northern limit of their ranges.\n\nTaiwan subtropical evergreen forests occupy most of the island including its mountainous interior. South Taiwan monsoon rainforests occupy low elevation coastal areas and some interior mountains at the southern end of the island, located within the Tropic of Cancer.\n\nOne-third of all of Taiwan's plants occur here, including 88 orchid species, and 160 plants endemic to the island.",
    "Local Species": "Two of the 14 bird species that occur in this ecoregion, and are endemic to the island of Taiwan (China) are Taiwan blue pheasant (Lophora swinhoi), and Taiwan long-tailed pheasant (Syrmaticus mikado).\n\nThe flora of this East Asian Island includes many distinctive conifers such as Amentotaxus formosana, Cephalotaxus wilsoniana, Chamaecyparis formosensis, Cunninghamia konishii, Picea morrisonicola, Podocarpus fasciculus, Pseudotsuga wilsoniana, and Taiwania cryptomerioides.\n\nOther significant plants include Cycad, Cycas taitungensis, and many angiosperms like Rhododendron, Camellia and Lauraceae, that are representative of the East Asian montane forests.\n\nMammals include the endemic monkey - Taiwanese macaque (Macaca cyclopis), and other species more widespread but rare, such as serow (Capricornis crispus), sambar (Cervus Unicolor), sitka deer (C. nippon), and Asiatic black bear (Selenarctos thibetanus). Amphibians include the Taipei tree frog (Rhacophorus taipcianus), and Formosan salamander (Hynobius formosanus).",

The typical height for the adult male and female serow are 73 and 74 cm respectively, to its shoulder. Horns sizes also differ very slightly with adult male horns averaging 32 mm in diameter at the base, and female horns averaging 31 mm in diameter at the base. \n\nThere is very little sexual dimorphism between the males and females, suggesting there is not much aggression and competition between males. The serow is a herbivore and typically considered a browser. It is primarily diurnal but also has nocturnal feeding periods.",
    "Threats": "Tourism, uncontrolled collection of wild plants, and large construction projects are some of the major threats to this ecoregion. Habitat in Kenting National Park is threatened by agriculture, mining, road construction, and thermal pollution from a nearby nuclear power plant.

This allowed the plants and animals adapted to moist conditions to seek refuge here and evolve into the specialized species that are found nowhere else on Earth.\n\nThis ecoregion is known for its globally outstanding biodiversity. These forests harbor large vertebrate faunas, including several newly discovered species. The Da Lat plateau, for example, has 15 to 16 species of conifers, representing the highest conifer diversity in Indochina.\n\nThis ecoregion has varying levels of rainfall of 1,500-3,850 mm annually. Mean annual temperatures are about 20C.",

    "Featured Species": "The Douc langur (Pygathrix nemaeus) is found in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. Its overall size is 61-76 cm, with males slightly larger than females. Males weigh approximately 7 kg, and females 5 kg. Their tails are about 56-76 cm long. It is a folivorous species, but it also consumes fruit, buds, flowers, and bamboo shoots. This species does not drink water but derives water from the food it eats. This is an arboreal and diurnal species and moves through the forest quadrupedally. The social system of the douc langur varies between a unimale and a multimale-multifemale system depending upon the location. They have a life span of about 25 years. \n\nThe main predator of the red-shanked douc langur is mankind. There is a very lucrative illegal wildlife trade in the red-shanked douc langur. During the Vietnam War the douc habitat was heavily bombed and sprayed with defoliants like Agent Orange. It is said that soldiers also used them for target practice.",
    "Threats": "Increased commercial logging, large hydropower projects, unsustainable levels of shifting cultivation, and intensive illegal hunting threaten the natural communities of the Annamite Range moist forests. Pressure on these mountain forests and the animals that live there is further increasing as people from the densely populated lowlands of Vietnam move into the region. The presence of unexploded ordnances similarly poses a severe threat to wildlife, researchers, and protected area staff."

Also found here are the Rafflesia blossoms which have a distinctive aroma – not unlike rotten meat – which attracts the flies that pollinate them. The Rafflesia plant also produces the largest flower in the world - up to 1 m (3.3 ft) wide. Also found here is Amorphophallus titanium, the world’s tallest flower at nearly 2 m (7 ft) in height. It, too, exudes a fetid odor that attracts pollinators.",
    "Featured Species": "Also known as Titan Arum, Bunga Bangkai or simply corpse flower, this plant is famous for the smell it emits when in bloom – variously described as rotting flesh, a dead elephant or rotten eggs! The scent attracts the insects that pollinate it. The bloom typically lasts for one day before the flower falls apart, and it takes several years to produce one bloom. It grows from a large tuber which can reach 80 kg (170 lb).\n\nSaid to be the tallest ‘flower’ (in sheer bulk) in the world, it is technically an inflorescence, or cluster of flowers. The flower typically stays open for 2 days. When the flower is fully open, it emits a repulsive scent (hence its Indonesian common name). The odor, strongest at night, is to attract pollinators, which in its Sumatran home are thought to be carrion beetles and sweat bees. \n\nA single huge umbrella-like leaf appears alternately with the flower and is itself spectacularly large. In cultivation it can reach over 3.5 m (12ft), its stalk in the wild can reach 6 m (20 ft) tall and 4.5 m (15 ft) across. The single stalk grows as thick as a person's thigh before branching into a compound leaf. An individual leaf may live for about a year before dying. The tuber then enters a short dormant period before producing another leaf or flower",
    "Threats": "Between 65 and 80% of these forests have already been lost to agriculture (mainly oil palm plantations) and logging. On the flat lowlands of southern Sumatra, for example, the vast stands of ironwood (Eusideroxylon zwageri), a species of great commercial importance producing an exceptionally durable timber, have been almost entirely destroyed. Sumatra is probably losing its natural vegetation faster than any other part of Indonesia"

    "Featured Species": "The tamaraw (Bubalus mindorensis) is one of the world's rarest mammals. It is a small wild buffalo weighing about 300 kg (660 lb). It lives in dense forest with open glades for grazing. It also prefers to be close to water for wallowing. It feeds on grasses, bamboo shoots and aquatic vegetation. Its small size and great strength enables it to push through dense jungle and climb steep mountains. It is usually solitary, although a calf may remain with the mother for a number of years.\n\nThe tamaraw was first recorded by Western science in 1888. It has only ever been sighted on the island of Mindoro. The island’s problems with malaria deterred human settlers, allowing the tamaraw freedom to roam the entire island. However, as the human population increased, the tamaraw’s range has diminished to just 2-3 sites and it has also had to adapt to a nocturnal habits to avoid human encounters. The population has declined dramatically, mainly because of hunting and other negative impacts of human settlement. Listed as critically endangered by IUCN, the current population is estimated to be between 30 and 200 individuals",
    "Threats": "Most of the forests and their species are severely threatened by extensive habitat degradation and loss due to logging, agriculture, soil erosion, and hunting.

    "Habitat Type": "Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests",
    "Geographic Location": "Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests",
    "Conservation Status": "Critical/Endangered",
    "About the Area": "The flora and fauna of this island display more affinities with certain islands in Indonesia, especially Borneo, than other islands in the Philippines. Palawan's almost 2,000 km of irregular coastline is dotted with 1,780 islands and islets, rocky coves, and sugar-white sandy beaches. It also harbors a vast stretch of virgin forest that carpets its mountain ranges.\n\nTwo World Heritage Sites are found here: Tubbataha Reef National Marine Park and the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park.\n\nIt contains a diverse range of habitats including montane forests, semi-deciduous forests, lowland rain forests, and mangroves, which in turn support many different kinds of plants and animals.\n\nPalawan has a relatively low population density, which has allowed the island to remain under fairly extensive forest cover. However, two thirds of this ecoregion has been cleared, and large areas have been degraded.",
    "Local Species": "The diversity of habitats support a number of endemic mammals such as the endangered Calamian deer (Axis calamianensis), Palawan fruitbat (Acerodon leucotis), Palawan stink badger (Mydaus marchei) and the horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus anderseni).\n\nEndemic bird fauna include the Palawan peacock-pheasant (Polyplectron emphanum), grey imperial-pigeon (Ducula pickeringii), blue-headed racquet-tail (Prioniturus platenae), Palawan flycatcher (Ficedula platenae), blue paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone cyanescens), Palawan tit (Parus amabilis), and the Palawan flowerpecker (Prionochilus plateni).",
    "Featured Species": "Palawan stink badgers (Mydaus marchei)are relatively small animals, up to around 45 cm in length. They have a stocky body set on short but muscular legs. They have a long, conical shaped face with an almost hairless, flexible snout. Both eyes and ears are very small. Their front paws sport long curved claws. They are predominantly dark brown in color, with a pale yellow cap on top of the head that fades to a stripe down its back to its shoulders.\n\nLittle is known about the dietary or breeding habits of this species. The badger has been described being both diurnal and nocturnal.\n\nSlow and ponderous, when attacked the Palawan stink badger will squirt an extremely unpleasant fluid from its anal glands over a distance of 1 m. Although very accurate with this weapon, it is reported to be not quite as noxious as that secreted by its Indonesian cousin. Palawan stink badgers are also reported to ‘play dead’ as a defense mechanism.",
    "Threats": "Despite supporting the highest percentage of remaining forest cover in all of the Philippines, illegal logging, hunting, and regular burning seriously threaten the ecoregion. In addition, the protected area system is weak and enforcement of the existing law inadequate."

Peninsular Malaysia is also home to the world's smallest rhinoceros, the two-horned Sumatran rhinoceros (Didermocerus sumatrensis).\n\nOne of the largest protected areas in Southeast Asia covers a sizeable section of the ecoregion. This large park, the Taman Negara National Park, features montane rainforests, unique limestone forests, and the largest area of pristine lowland dipterocarp forest left in Malaysia. The highest mountain in Peninsular Malaysia - Mount Tahan - is located within the park.",

As a primarily nocturnal creature, this distinctive coloration provides very effective camouflage. \n\nExclusively vegetarian, this animal forages for the tender shoots and leaves of more than 115 species of plants. They usually prefer to live near water and often bathe and swim, and they are also able to climb steep slopes. Malayan Tapirs are listed as vulnerable by IUCN.",
    "Threats": "Logging both in the highlands and lowlands, conversion of lowland forest for agriculture, tourism development, and road construction causing fragmentation and loss of forests are the predominant threats in this ecoregion. Other threats include hydro projects for power and irrigation, mining and associated road building, and quarrying around limestone areas.\n\nExpansion of urban areas also threatens some of the last remnants of coastal dipterocarp forest. Unfortunately, the majority of mammals and birds live in primary or older secondary forests, making it essential that these dwindling areas are protected"

    "Featured Species": "The most distinctive trait of Proboscis monkey (Nasalis larvatus) is the male's large protruding nose. Whilst the purpose of this large nose is unknown, it is thought that females are most attracted to males with the biggest noses.\n\nThe average body mass for an adult male proboscis monkey is between 16 and 22 kg, with females slightly smaller at 7-12 kg. This is a sexually dimorphic species, especially in body size. The proboscis monkey has interdigital webbing that makes it an excellent swimmer. Its favorite foods are fruits, seeds and young leaves. It also eats invertebrates including mosquitoes, caterpillars, and insect larvae. This is a diurnal and semi-terrestrial species. This species always sleeps near rivers, 0 to 15 meters from the river's edge.\n\nThe proboscis monkey moves through the forest and on land quadrupedally. This species avoids areas with heavy deforestation, such as agricultural land. The group sizes range from 3 to 32 individuals.",
    "Threats": "Damaging human activities such as commercial and illegal logging, large-scale agriculture for oil palm or tea, mining, dam construction, shifting cultivation, illegal collection of species, and infrastructure development have meant that well over half of the lowland forests are now gone, with large fires burning away the remaining tracts.\n\nIf the current deforestation trend continues, Borneo's lowland forests, and their biodiversity, will be gone within a decade. Borneo's mountain forests have more protection and are not as economically attractive, so they still remain in good shape. However, it will only be a matter of time before they too face similar threats."

    "Featured Species": "The Amami Rabbit (Pentalagus furnessi) or Amami no Kuro Usagi, also known as the Ryukyu Rabbit, is a primitive dark-furred rabbit. Often called a living fossil, the Amami Rabbit is a living remnant of ancient rabbits that once lived on the Asian mainland, where they died out, remaining only on the 2 small islands where they survive today.\n\nThis rabbit has short legs, a somewhat bulky body, rather large and curved claws which it uses to dig out its nest holes. Its ears are also significantly smaller than those of other rabbits or hares.\n\nLittle is known about the social or breeding habits of this endangered nocturnal rabbit. However, Amami rabbits are noted for making calling noises, which sound similar to a pika; this makes them unique as most rabbits do not make calling noises.\n\nIsland residents introduced the mongoose to these islands in an attempt to control the population of poisonous snakes. This intervention has backfired as the mongoose prefers to diet on the Amami rabbit, threatening the very survival of this enigmatic creature",
    "Threats": "Developments such as dam construction and logging threaten remaining natural habitats. Conversion of lowland evergreen forests through expansion of agricultural and residential areas is a major threat. For example, a few Iriomote wild cats are killed in traffic accidents every year. Introduced predators such as the Japanese weasel have also caused a dramatic decrease in native skink populations"

    "Featured Species": "The name 'mouse deer' (Tragulus napu) refers to its extremely small size (although it is not a true deer), while the seemingly oxymoronic 'larger' is in reference to its size when compared to its smaller cousin.\n\nThe greater mouse deer’s body length is 70-75 cm while its weight is 5-8 kg. Rather than horns or antlers, the male has a set of elongated upper canines or tusks that protrude from the sides of the mouth like fangs. The female larger Malay mouse deer has the potential to be pregnant throughout her adult life, often having just 1-2 hours to catch her breath between giving birth and becoming pregnant again.\n\nLarger Malay mouse deer are nocturnal, and hence rarely seen. Extremely territorial by nature, both sexes of larger Malay mouse deer regularly mark their territories with urine, faeces, and secretions from an intermandibular gland under the chin. When agitated, larger Malay mouse deer drum on the ground with their hoofs at 4 times per second. Their diet consists of buds, leaves, fruit, and probably small amounts of animal food.",
    "Threats": "There is a need for more protected areas in hilly regions, as they are vulnerable to human population pressures and activities.\n\nSpecies are also at risk. For example, pileated gibbon populations are declining due the rapid destruction of their forest habitats. It is estimated that all species of gibbons will be at risk of extinction in the near future due to deforestation. The widespread presence of antipersonnel landmines poses a severe threat to both wildlife and humans."

Golden toads have never been widespread, but they used to be abundant in a handful of areas of cloud-shrouded tropical forest above the Costa Rican town of Monteverde. No one has seen a golden toad since 1989, and they are thought to be one of the first species to become extinct as a direct result of climate change.",
    "Threats": "Threats include deforestation from logging, and conversion of land for agriculture. New access roads, malaria control, and incentives for migration to these areas in the last few decades have encouraged settlement and resource extraction from the area. Illegal logging and squatting is making in-roads into the remaining large forest blocks in Nicaragua."

This event allowed new species to evolve over time.\n\nThis ecoregion is full of interesting and unique corners such as the \"La Planada crater\" in Colombia. Here, the ecosystem inside the crater is different to the one just outside because the species inside benefit from higher temperatures and protection from the wind.",

It is arboreal and tends to live in areas of secondary growth or mixed forest. Natural groups vary in size from 3 to 15 individuals, which show some degree of territorial defense. There is virtually no difference in size or appearance between males and females. In captivity, they can live for up to 13 years. As with other tamarins and marmosets, males contribute heavily to parental care, and it is likely that some groups are polyandrous.",

It is noted as the only species of bird to have a bill longer then the rest of its body. This allows it to feed on flowers with long corollas such as Passiflora mixta. The tongue is therefore also unusually long. Most of these flowers hang straight down, and the hummingbird comes up from below to feed on their nectar and pollinate them. \n\nHummingbirds are rather unusual birds in the relatively large size of their sternum - it makes up much of the volume of the body skeleton and has a very large keel for muscle attachment. In this species especially, you can imagine that very powerful flight muscles are needed to propel that bill across the landscape! \n\nIn a bird wing, the primaries are the source of thrust, and hummingbirds depend on thrust for much of their flight; the lift provided by the inner wing feathers in most birds is of little importance to hummingbirds.",
    "Threats": "The region is under intense pressure from a growing human population due to conversion for agriculture and pasture, gathering wood for fuel and timber, mining operations, and logging. Continuing degradation of forest fragments is an additional threat. Timber exploitation, illegal hunting, cattle ranching and coca production pose additional threats. There are no reserves or other conservation projects protecting this ecosystem."

The muzzle is long and narrow, and the teeth are strong. Underparts are usually pale, dirty gray-brown to yellow-brown - the fur is much shorter than on the back.\n\nA formidable aerial night hunter, this large predatory species takes a huge range of vertebrate prey including amphibians, reptiles, small birds and mammals (including other species of bats). Insects are also included, especially large crickets, cicadas etc. Surprisingly, a small amount of fruit is also eaten, making this animal in the strictest sense an omnivore.\n\nOne young or pup is produced each year, and the mother is very attentive and gentle with her offspring. The male is always in attendance too and will frequently sleep with both mother and young completely wrapped in his wings.",
    "Threats": "New and planned roads are opening the Napo Moist Forests to degradation through colonization, agriculture, intensive hunting, oil exploration, and timber exploitation.\n\nVast regions of the Western Arc have been ceded to oil companies for development, increasing the threat of oil spills.

All pit vipers are characterized by the presence of facial pits, a heat-sensitive organ used to detect prey. Like many pit vipers, the fer-de-lance is a sit-and-wait predator, using its cryptic coloration to ambush passing prey.\n\nFer-de-lance ranges from northeastern Mexico through Colombia and Ecuador, and is largely ubiquitous throughout its range, occurring in both wet and dry regions, high and low elevations, and in primary forest to areas of high disturbance and human activity. It is also very prolific, having a litter size of up to 86 young.\n\nIt also has highly potent venom, and is responsible for many snakebites to humans each year in Central America (primarily to farmers and fieldworkers), more than any other tropical snake. Despite its relevance to human health, very little data exists on the behavior, movements, or habitat usage of the species in the wild.",
    "Threats": "Deforestation, over fishing, agricultural conversion, colonisation, animal and plant collecting, large-scale cattle ranching and road construction pose significant threats.\n\nLarge quantities of ornamental fish, particularly arawana (Osteoglossum bicirrhosum), are harvested for international trade in the Caqueta moist forests and its trafficking should be strongly regulated.\n\nThe leaves of the palm Leopoldinia piassaba are harvested destructively to make brooms for international markets, and this species may be overexploited.

Males are only slightly larger than females. Their ears are small and round, and like their nostrils, can be closed by special muscles when underwater. \n\nThe fur of river otters is so dense that water never reaches their skin, even when they're swimming. Giant otter guard hairs trap air and keep the dense inner fur dry. Their coat is mainly brown or gray and is usually darker on the back and lighter on the chest. Lips, chin, throat, and upper chest exhibit white blotches - which may merge into a single white ‘bib’.\n\nGiant river otters are social, typically forming groups of 4-8 individuals. Cubs are reared in a central den area (1.2-1.8 m wide) that connects to an adjacent waterway via a tunnel or series of tunnels. Its life span is approximately 14 years.\n\nThe giant river otter has become rare or nonexistent over most of its range. This decline is largely due to habitat loss and commercial fur hunting.

Birds include red-necked tanager (Tangara cyanocephala), and many endemics such as the red-billed currasow (Crax blumenbachii), seven-colored tanager (Tanagara fastuosa), blue-bellied parrot (Triclaria malachitacea), and the three-toed jacamar (Jacamaralcyon tridactyla).",
    "Featured Species": "The golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia) has a dark grey face which is surrounded by a thick mane of golden hair which cascades down its back like a lion’s mane. It weighs around 400-800 g (14-29 oz) and is 20-25 cm long. The hands, fingers and claws are long and thin to probe into bark for grubs. It is an omnivore, although most of its diet consists of fruit.\nThe golden lion tamarin is diurnal and primarily arboreal, forming small groups of up to 14 individuals, led by a breeding pair.\nOnce listed as critically endangered by IUCN, the status of the golden lion tamarin is now considered endangered. With its survival threatened by devastating forest clearance, WWF and others have worked to set up new protected areas and supported the release into the wild of animals bred in zoos. The golden lion tamarin’s attractive appearance makes it vulnerable to the further threat from the illegal pet trade.",
    "Threats": "Two of the world's largest cities - Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, lie within the Atlantic Forests ecoregion, indicating the challenge of conserving the remaining habitat in the area. In a recent study, just 2.5 acres (one hectare) of the forest were found to have 450 different species of trees! Protecting this diversity, while meeting the needs of growing metropolitan and rural populations, is a serious challenge.\nLogging, agricultural expansion, and associated road building threaten this globally important region of biological diversity. Habitat loss, hunting, and the wildlife trade threaten many species.\nGiven the high levels of local richness and endemism and the extensive loss of natural habitat, over 95% in many areas, the probability of species extinctions is high without intensive conservation efforts. Relatively extensive, but generally unprotected blocks of forest remain in the southern portion of the ecoregion, particularly in Argentina and Paraguay"

    "About the Area": "This Global ecoregion is made up of 9 terrestrial ecoregions: Cook Islands tropical moist forests; Fiji tropical dry forests; Fiji tropical moist forests; Tuamotu tropical moist forests; Tongan tropical moist forests; Society Islands tropical moist forests; Samoan tropical moist forests; Marquesas tropical moist forests; and Tubuai tropical moist forests.\n\nThe South Pacific islands of Fiji and Samoa were once clothed in tropical moist and dry forests, including rainforests on the higher islands. Forests’ relative isolation, large size and complex topography and unusual biogeographic history have all contributed to the archipelagos' highly endemic biota. Over half of the vascular plant species are endemic, with many single-island and single-site endemics.",
    "Local Species": "Selected species include the endangered Fiji iguanas (Brachyolophus spp.), orange dove (Ptilinopus victor), and the red shining parrot (Prosopeia tabuensis).\n\nFiji is notable for having an endemic family of primitive tree, the Degeneraceae, distantly related to magnolias. There are 27 native passerines, including 4 endemic species, and 3 parrots, 4 pigeons, and a rail that are all endemic.\n\nTuamotus is an archipelago comprising 76 islands and coral atolls. Endemic species include the Tuamotu sandpiper (Prosobonia cancellata), which is now restricted to uninhabited, rat-free islands. The endemic parrot, the Henderson lory (Vini stepheni), feeds largely on the nectar of 2 plant species, a degree of specialization unknown in nectarivorous birds elsewhere.\n\nTonga supports 419 angiosperm plants and fern species with approximately 3% endemic, including some spectacular Hibiscus spp. The Marquesas are among the most isolated archipelagos in the world and thus have a highly endemic biota. They support 320 native vascular plant species with 42% endemism. Also present a fairly rich invertebrate fauna with a notable diversity of at least 78 land and freshwater snail species and 16 fruit fly.",
    "Featured Species": "The Tuamotu sandpiper (Prosobonia cancellata) is a small wader with a very short, sharp black bill. It is about 17 cm tall. It is variably mottled and streaked with dull brown, with a bold white superciliary stripe. Its voice is a high squeaking note. It is found on beaches, shores and in scrub, preferring open areas along atoll shorelines, where it feeds on insects among coral rubble and leaf-litter. It is non-migratory but may visit islands where it does not nest.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly threatened as islands become disturbed by human activity and as habitat is destroyed for coconut plantations. The introduction of rats, particularly black rat (Rattus rattus), is a further serious threat and, combined with cats, has probably eliminated the species from all but the most infrequently visited islands. It is listed as endangered by IUCN.",
    "Threats": "Loss of habitat from agriculture and commercial logging, and the introduction of predators by humans have resulted in a large number of species being threatened with extinction. Areas have been so depleted by burning that very little vegetation grows and downpours cause massive erosion. Introduced plants, such as Psidium guajava, Lantana camara and Mikania micrantha are serious weeds degrading natural communities. \n\nNuclear testing conducted by the French government has devastated many of the atolls in the southeastern portions of the Tuamotu Archipelago. Predicted rises in sea level from global warming will inundate most low-lying atolls of this ecoregion, likely causing the extinction of several threatened species such as the Polynesian ground-dove."

    "Conservation Status": "Critical/Endangered",
    "About the Area": "For 70 million years, the Hawaiian Islands have been isolated from the rest of the world by vast stretches of the Pacific Ocean. This isolation has resulted in the evolution of an incredible diversity of fungi, mosses, snails, birds, and other wildlife. These moist forests have an extraordinary percentage of endemic species, including 95% of plant species, and 99% of invertebrates.\n\nSeveral groups have radiated into many species - for example over one-third of the world's fruit fly species are found here.\n\nHawaii includes the world's wettest rain forest on Mount Waialeale, which averages 1,143 cm of rainfall per year.",
    "Local Species": "Unique species include Hawaiian land snails, Hawaiian lobelias, Eupithecia moths (predatory caterpillars), Hawaiian silversword alliance (Madiinae), Hawaiian honeycreepers (Drepanidae) - believed to have evolved from a single ancestor, in the same way that Darwin's finches evolved in the Galapagos Islands, these birds have remarkably shaped bills, adapted to different feeding habits.\n\nThese forests are also noted for the diverse assemblage of shrubs and trees that were found within the Koa and ‘Ohi’a forests. Bogs occur on montane plateaus or depressions and consist of a variety of sedges, grasses, ferns, mosses, small trees and shrubs that form irregular hummocks. The once abundant land snails (with 99% endemism) are now over 50% extinct with many of the remainder endangered.",
    "Featured Species": "The Happy face spider (Theridion grallator) is normally shy and retiring. It lives on the undersides of leaves in rainforests. The happy-face spider is endemic to the Hawaiian archipelago but is only found on 4 of the islands: Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii. It hunts primarily at night and feeds on small insects that it encounters.\n\nIts name is derived from the colorful markings on its abdomen that look very similar to a smiling human face. The pattern is variable and may even be different colors. The happy face spider is one of the few spiders known to take care of its young.",
    "Threats": "Lowland and foothill moist forests have been largely eliminated. Hawaii has already lost two-thirds of its original forests to agriculture, clearing, and fire, and half its native birds through habitat loss and introduced disease. Saving the remaining native species and habitats is now a race against time. \n\nDeforestation, grazing, introduced species, development, and recreational activities are all real problems. Several important areas of relatively intact tropical moist forests currently have no or incomplete protection"

The tropical dry forests in the western part of the island support hundreds of endemic plant and animal species, including numerous chameleon species, the world’s most endangered tortoise, the Angonoka tortoise, and the rare aye-aye. There are 7 species of baobab trees as compared to only one in all of Africa.\n\nPeriods of steady rainfall alternate with drier periods in the areas where Madagascar's dry forests grow. The dry forests are home to rare animals and plants adapted to life where rain may not fall for up to 8 months. Many of these creatures, such as lemurs and fossas, are found nowhere else on Earth.\n\nTemperatures remain warm throughout the year.",

    "Featured Species": "The Malagasy giant jumping rat (Hypogeomys antimena)- or vositse, as it is known to the local Malagasy people, is no ordinary rat. Rabbit sized, with soft greyish-brown fur, large delicate ears and a mass of softly quivering whiskers, the giant jumping rat can sit and move like a tiny kangaroo, balanced on its oversized hind legs, using its long tail for balance.\n\nThe giant jumping rat can leap almost 1 m (3 ft) in the air to avoid predators - namely the puma-like fossa. Nocturnal, giant jumping rats leave their burrow at dusk to feed on fallen fruit and seeds. Food is consumed in a manner similar to squirrels whereby it is held in the forepaws and manipulated in the mouth while the rat sits semi-upright on its haunches.\n\nThe wild giant jumping rats are born at the start of the warm rainy season in late November and early December. A litter generally consists of 1-2. These rats live in burrows that typically consist of a complex of tunnels.\n\nHabitat loss and competition from introduced black rats threaten its survival. It is listed as endangered by IUCN.",

Rainfall is not as consistent as in nearby moist forests, with a pronounced dry season.\n\nLesser Sunda Islands are also known as Nusa Tenggara. They stretch across the Java Sea between Australia and Borneo. These forests are the richest in mammals within the Southeast Asian islands. Although the number of animal species is low, the number of marsupials and mammals, many of which are endemic, demonstrates the Asian and Australian influences on the region's biodiversity.",
    "Local Species": "The mammal fauna in Lesser Sundas deciduous forests consists of 50 species, including 5 ecoregional endemics, including the critically endangered Flores shrew (Suncus mertensi) and the vulnerable Komodo rat (Komodomys rintjanus).

The Average adult size is 1.6-2.4 m long.\n\nThis species is endemic to the Lesser Sundas islands of Indonesia.",
    "Threats": "Accidental and deliberate fires to increase fodder for livestock, cattle grazing, and increasing population on the islands - all pose a threat to the remaining habitat, increasing rates of deforestation. Logging has also grown in importance- for instance, Damar Island was densely forested until the late 1980s, when logging began on a large scale to supply timber to the outer arc islands, where the forests had already been more heavily exploited. This problem is worsening as the human populations expand"

    "Featured Species": "Known also as the wild forest ox of Indochina, the enormous kouprey (Bos sauveli), endemic to Cambodia, is the least known species of wild cattle alive today. Grey to dark brown or black, their bodies are massive but narrow, legs long and backs humped. Males may stand 2 m at the shoulder and weigh up to 900 kg. Adult males have a pronounced dewlap, up to 40 cm (16 in) long. Both sexes have curiously notched nostrils and long tails. The horns of the female are lyre-shaped with antelope-like upward spirals. The widespread horns in the male arch forward and upward.\n\nThey live a skittish, nocturnal life in inaccessible habitats consisting of open deciduous forests, grasslands, wooded grasslands and patches of closed monsoon forest. Most live in areas receiving 100-200 cm (40-80 in) of precipitation per year and there are indications that they move to higher elevations during the rainy season. They typically graze in open areas during the day, entering the forest for shelter from the sun, refuge from predators, and to seek food when the grasslands are dry. Like other wild cattle species, they are primarily grazers but will browse as well.\n\nThe kouprey was only identified in 1937, but there has been no scientific sighting since 1957. Unconfirmed reports from traders and occasional tracks give hope that it may yet be extant. It is listed as critically endangered by IUCN.",
    "Threats": "Much of the original monsoon forest, particularly in Vietnam, has been degraded through logging and clearing for agriculture. Some areas have been subjected to burning or conversion to teak plantations. \n\nFrom small, homemade crossbows used to kill small mammals for local consumption to bombs hidden in baited traps to kill tigers and pitfall traps for elephants, hunting has taken a very heavy toll on wildlife. The ravages of war and conflict have also had lasting effects; mines and bombs scattered across the landscape and the easy availability of automatic weapons that have replaced the crossbows have had deadly consequences.\n\nIn Laos, protected areas suffer from shifting cultivation, excessive non-timber forest product harvesting, wildlife poaching (for domestic use and local and international trade), and illegal logging."

In summer its coat is a brown or reddish-buff color, with the fur smooth and highly glossy. In winter the white belly and throat fur is in sharper contrast. The tail is medium long and the chinkara can be easily recognized by the constant flickering of the tail. The average horn length of males is 25.5-30.5 cm (10-12 in) measured over the curve, with record horns reaching just over 39cm (15.5in).\n\nThe Chinkara is almost wholly nocturnal in foraging activity, though they will emerge to start feeding before sunset. Chinkaras are adapted to browsing and they will feed on various bushes and green twigs. They also take leaves of different plants and can go without water for days. A very adaptable animal, it seems to be able to exist in extensive sand-dune areas down to sea level as well as in stony plateaus and low hilly regions up to 1,500 m elevation.",

But this diversity is severely threatened; less than 2% of the ecoregion’s dry forests now remain.\n\nThe main island is Grand terre which has an extremely diverse soil substrate, with ultramafic rock forming about one-third of the island. The island is also very diverse topographically and climatically. Average annual rainfall is about 2,000 mm - 4,000 mm. \n\nThe plant formations here vary according to the intensity of the hydrous stress that the vegetation undergoes during the dry season, the proximity of the coastline, and very probably the type of geological substratum.\n\nRecently, a presumed extinct species of parchment bark tree was rediscovered.",

    "About the Area": "The dry forests of Bolivia and Brazil are among the richest dry forest ecosystems in the world.\n\nThe plant and animal life of this ecoregion bears similarities to the species of the distant Caatinga, Misiones, and Tucumano forests. Most of the Chiquitano forest lies within the eastern lowlands of Santa Cruz, Bolivia, with smaller patches extending into western Mato Grosso, Brazil.\n\nAlthough without rainfall and leaves for certain parts of the year, these dry forests still contain an incredible abundance of life including many endemics. Flooding and fires are both common in this region, so many of these trees can withstand temporary flooding or have fire-resistant bark.\n\nThis forest takes its name from the indigenous groups, Chiquitanos, which inhabited them at the time of European colonization.",
    "Local Species": "This unique forest shelters a critically endangered reptile, the broad-snouted caiman (Caiman latirostris); an endangered bird, the black-and-tawny seedeater (Sporophila nigrofufa), and at least 3 mammals - the giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus), maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). There are a further 3 birds, 1 reptile and 12 mammals listed as vulnerable.\n\nSelected species include the barefaced currasow (Crax fasciolata), puma (Felis concolor), jaguar (Panthera onca), and the lianas (Bignoniaceae spp.).\n\nThese forests are dominated by soto, curupau, cuchi, cuta, ajo-ajo, tajibo, and tuseque trees.\n\nStill relatively unstudied, this ecoregion suggests several good candidates for endemic taxa. The Sunsas Ridge limestone caves are rich with bat colonies that have never been studied.",
    "Featured Species": "A cat of many names, the puma (Felis concolor) is also known as the cougar, panther or mountain lion. The puma has a small, broad head with small rounded ears, a powerful body with long hind legs and tail, which is tipped with black. It weighs around 60-100 kg (150-230 lb). The 2-3 cubs are born with spotted coats which fade as they mature.\n\nThe male puma can often patrol areas in excess of 100 square miles, although these will overlap the territories of several females who maintain smaller ranges. The puma hunts alone, by day or night and will cache its food, if large enough, in dense undergrowth, returning to it over several days. In hunting the puma uses the strength of its powerful hind legs to lunge at its prey with single running jumps that can reach in excess of 12 m (40 ft). The puma makes many sounds, including an almost humanlike scream when courting, but it cannot roar.",
    "Threats": "Pollution, wildlife exploitation, agricultural expansion, burning, and grazing together constitute major threats. Habitat degradation is also significant, partly due to the Paraguay-Parana Hidrovia Dam project and uncontrolled logging.\n\nThe third major threat is habitat fragmentation with improved and new access ways promoted by multinational energy companies (pipelines, power lines and electricity generation) and the transportation sector (roads, ports)."

    "About the Area": "The Atlantic Dry Forests ecoregion occurs in patches extending from north to south between the Cerrado Grasslands and Caatinga Scrub ecoregions of eastern Brazil. The climate is mostly tropical, receiving between 86 and 100 cm (34-39 in) of rain annually and having a 5-month dry season.\n\nA large ecological transition area between neighboring moist forests and grasslands, this ecoregion provides diverse habitats that support many unique communities of species. A combination of geomorphological, geological, climatic, hydrological and vegetation features helps to delineate this ecoregion.",
    "Local Species": "Dry forests are fairly dense, up to 25 to 30 m high and characterized by tree species such as Cavanillesia arborea, Cedrela fissilis, Schinopsis brasiliensis, Astronium urundeuva, Aspidosperma macrocarpa and Tabebuia sp. The most remarkable tree is certainly Cavanillesia arborea, with a huge, bottle-shaped trunk that reaches its maximum diameter of 1.5 m or more about 3 m above ground level. It attains heights of about 27 m.\n\nAmong the bird species that occur here are several endemics such as gilt-edged tanager (Tangara cyanoventris), great xenops (Megaxenops parnaguae), hooded visorbearer (Augastes lumachellus), Caatinga nighthawk (Chordeiles vielliardi), pale-throated serra finch (Sporophila frontalis), and narrow-billed antwren (Formicivora iheringi).",
    "Featured Species": "The gilt-edged tanager (Tangara cyanoventris) is found in eastern Brazil from Bahia to São Paulo. They inhabit forest and secondary growth as well as clearings and tend to be found between 500 and 1,000 meters above sea level.\n\nThey are golden-yellow above with heavy black streaks on the back and lighter black streaks on the crown. Underparts are mostly turquoise moving to green on the lower belly and yellow on the lower flanks. The forehead and throat are black.",
    "Threats": "Only 30% of the original forest remains; agriculture stands as the main threat to habitat destruction. The high biomass of these forests makes them important sources of fuel for Brazil's steel and pig iron industries, which run entirely on charcoal. The most diverse dry forests on flat terrain and rich soil have been completely removed."

Approximately 22% of native Hawaiian plant species are found in this ecoregion. Coastal and lowland dry shrublands occur on the lowest leeward slopes of the higher Hawaiian Islands and on all but the summit regions of Lana'i, Kaho'olawe, and Ni'ihau. Hawaiian high shrublands range from open shrublands to alpine grasslands and deserts.",
    "Local Species": "The Hawaiian Lowland Shrublands have an amazing amount of endemic plants that are found only in this ecoregion-more than 90%!

Common species include Erythrina sandwicensis, Diospyros sandwicensis, Reynoldsia sandwicensis and Nothocestrum spp. Also found here is the palila (Loxioides bailleui), an endangered finch-like bird.\n\nThe Hawaiian nene goose (Branta sandvicensis) lives in high shrubland areas, and endangered Hawaiian dark-rumped petrels nest in burrows in subalpine and alpine cinderlands.",
    "Featured Species": "The Nene (or Hawaiian) Goose (Branta sandvicensis) is the state bird of Hawaii and endemic to the archipelago. The Nene in some ways resembles its closest living relative, the Canada goose (Branta canadensis) although the Nene is smaller in size, reaching lengths of 53-66 cm (21-26 in). The Nene has yellow-buff cheeks and black feathers on the back of its neck, the top of its head, and its face. Diagonal rows of creamy-white feathers form deep furrows along its neck.\n\nMales and females are similar in size and markings. The Nene's calls include a muted 'moo' and a loud 'haw'. The breeding season, which is perhaps the longest breeding season of all gooses, extends from November until June with incubation lasting 30 days and the chicks fledging after 10 to 12 weeks. This extended breeding season contributes to the Nene's susceptibility to introduced predators, with mongooses, feral cats and dogs often feeding on Nene eggs and young. \n\nIt is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN, and its population has recovered from a low of around 30 to around 3,000, largely thanks to captive breeding programmes.",
    "Threats": "Clearing and burning of lowland dry forests began with the arrival of Polynesians and the last remnants are being destroyed today through continued development, expansion of agriculture and pasture, and burning.\n\nOver 90% of the Lowland Shrublands has been lost due to human development and alien vegetation. Fire, weed invasions, feral animals, especially goats and deer, threaten the stability of this ecoregion."

    "Local Species": "The most speciose plant families represent Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Poaceae and Euphorbiaceae. In total, 12 species of oak trees are found within these conifer forests.\n\nTogether these plants support an impressive array of bird species including the Mexican jay (Aphelocoma ultramarina), Mexican chickadee (Parus sclateri), zone-tailed hawk (Buteo albonotatus), maroon-fronted parrots (Rhynchopsitta terrisi), thick-billed parrots (R. pachyrhyncha), Strickland's woodpecker (Picoides stricklandi), and Montezuma quail (Cyrtonyx montezumae). Predators with large ranges, such as Gray wolf (Canis lupis) and Jaguar (Panthera onca) frequent these habitats as well.\n\nThe Sierra Madre Occidental pine oak forests are rich in endemic and endangered plant and animal species including over 85 species of reptiles (of which 22 are endemic), 20 amphibians (12 of them endemic), and a number of endemic birds, as well. In the northern portion, over 15 species of pine trees and more than 25 types of oaks occur. The 27 species of conifer trees and 21 oak species recorded in these mountains, make them a center of diversity for these groups of trees.

Their backs and flanks are gray and they have paler grayish underparts. The Mexican Chickadee has a long black bib, which extends from its chin down onto its upper breast. A whitish band below the bib extends down the center of the belly. The typical adult wingspan is 18 cm, and their overall length is 13 cm.\n\nAlthough primarily nonmigratory, Mexican Chickadees sometimes fly to lower elevations during the cold of winter. The Mexican Chickadee's song is distinct from other chickadees; it is a complex burry trilled whistle of chischu-wur and a rich cheelee. They travel in pairs or small groups, and may join multi-species feeding flocks.\n\nThe female lays between 5-8 ovate white eggs, marked with fine reddish brown spots. Their breeding biology is not well known, but it is estimated that eggs are incubated for 11-14 days by the female, and the altricial young fledge in 18-21 days.",
    "Threats": "Chief threats include overgrazing, clearing of forests for timber and fuel wood, and development. Other problems stem from recreational pressures and use of the area for military exercises. Exploitation of dead trees for paper fabrication has driven the imperial woodpecker, which once used these trees for nesting and seed storage, to extinction. \n\nThe imperial woodpecker, the world's largest woodpecker at a height of almost 60 cm (2 ft), was once widespread in Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak forests but is now almost certainly extinct because of the loss of old-growth habitat and hunting pressures."

Reptiles include several iguanid species including Leiocephalus macropus, L.onaneyi, Anolis alayoni and A.vanidicus.\n\nThe endemic Hispaniolan emerald hummingbird - locally known as zumbador, which means ‘buzzer’ in Spanish- is found in the Hispaniolan pine forests. The male of this species, which measures about 10 cm in length, is the color of emeralds, with a dark forked tail and a black patch on his chest.",
    "Featured Species": "Cuban trogon (Priotelus temnurus)\n\nThe trogons have soft, colorful, feathers with definite male and female plumage. As an adult bird the Trogon stands about 25 – 35 cm tall with short rounded gray wings a short yellow, wide beak, short neck and large eyes that help the bird to find food in the dark woodlands. On its face it has a black mask and a dull colored eye ring, a green chest, head and back. Across its chest it has a white stripe, and its stomach and the bottom of its tail is red. Their long tail is squared at the end. The female's plumage is paler than the male's.\n\nThey generally perch stiff and straight on a sycamore tree branch or on some stream side tree. Trogons are birds of the woods, inhabiting areas in the lowlands to the mountain forests. Trogons live in pairs or alone.\n\nThe word trogon is Greek for ‘nibbling’ and refers to the fact that these birds gnaw holes in trees to make their nests. They nest in holes in trees or termite nests, laying white or pastel colored eggs. They feed on insects and fruit, and their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and arboreal habits. Although their flight is fast, they are reluctant to fly any distance. Trogons do not migrate.",
    "Threats": "Mining, citrus plantations, grazing, uncontrolled burning, exploitation of threatened bird, plant and landsnail populations and logging severely threaten the ecoregion. \n\nReplacing native pine with exotic trees does not often meet the needs of the animals in this habitat. The endemic Hispaniolan parakeet is threatened because it is shot to protect crops and captured to supply the domestic and international pet trade."

The highest diversity of reptiles and amphibians in the country is found here, and the intermontane lakes provide habitat to many endemic frogs and axolotls (primitive salamanders with gills). Monarch butterflies, which undertake the largest migratory route of all insects (4,000 km or 2,500 miles), spend winters hibernating in these cool and moist volcanic forests.\n\nThe Oaxaca pine-oak forests house the highest diversity of amphibians and reptiles in Mexico and support several birds endemic to the region, such as the grey-barred wren, the bearded wood-partridge, and the dwarf jay. At least 45 oak (Quercus) species grow here, as well as 2 highly endangered tree species, a firand and a cypress.",
    "Featured Species": "The volcano rabbit (Romerolagus diazi) is the 2nd smallest rabbit after the pygmy rabbit. It weighs around 390 - 600g. It has small round ears and short legs. The fur is short and dense with the top and sides of the rabbit being dark brown to black.\n\nIt feeds on the green leaves of zacaton grasses, the young leaves of spiny herbs and the bark of alder trees. It is mostly nocturnal and crepuscular. It lives in groups of 2 - 5 animals in runways and burrows among grass tussocks and is restricted to the pine forests on volcanic peaks near Mexico City. Volcano rabbits can breed throughout the year, but there is a distinct reproductive peak in the warm, rainy summer. \n\nA unique behavior of the volcano rabbit is the tendency to utter high-pitched, penetrating whistles. If alarmed the volcano rabbit gives a sharp call and hurries to a burrow.\n\nIt is listed as endangered by IUCN.",
    "Threats": "Commercial logging, land conversion for cultivation, and overgrazing by livestock pose serious threats to the ecoregion. The Chimalapas montane forests are facing serious threats from logging and agricultural expansion. Many of these forests have almost vanished entirely. Plans for building a dam and a major highway threaten the largest fragments of undisturbed forests.\n\nFragmentation is a growing concern as remnant patches of natural habitat become smaller and further apart. Another growing problem is game hunting of wildlife such as paca, deer, tapir and monkeys for game meat, and the hunting of predators (ocelot, puma) to protect stock. \n\nHigh levels of air pollution have also damaged the pine-oak forests surrounding Mexico City. Fire suppression is another problem for some fire-adapted forests, because fuels build up and the very hot fires kill trees."

The toes are long and thin and terminate in a sharp claw designed to assist with climbing. Total length is around 35 cm, over half of which is tail.\n\nSouthern forest dragons are also known as angle-headed dragons because of the shape of their head. Although appearing slow and sluggish, forest dragons can move with speed and agility when pursuing potential prey items such as beetles, cockroaches and spiders.

    "Featured Species": "Takahe (Porphyrio mantelli)\n\nAn adult takahe weighs up to 3 kg and stands up to 50 cm tall, about the size of a chicken. As is typical of most of the flightless birds, it has short stout but strong (red) legs. The takahe's impressive red beak is quite solid. It has small wings that are only used for display. They can still fly, but very poorly and only for short distances, normally as a means of escape. In the Fiordland native habitat, curled, mid-ribbed and broad-leaved snow tussock grasses provide food and shelter for takahe.\n\nNesting pairs build a raised ground nest of snow tussock grasses in October after the snow has melted. 80% of the 1-3 eggs laid each year hatch after 30 days of incubation. Chicks are fed by both parents for 3 months. Only 1 chick will normally survive the first winter.\n\nTakahe is now protected in the wilderness of Fiordland National Park, which is New Zealand's largest national park, and a World Heritage area. It is listed as endangered by IUCN.",
    "Threats": "Threats include logging, burning, invasive species introductions, and tourism. Raising sheep for wool is the biggest land use in Richmond temperate forests, and much of the land has been converted to pasture. \n\nNew Zealand’s native species evolved for 80 million years in the absence of mammalian predators after splitting off from the supercontinent Gondwana. As a result, many endemic birds are flightless and completely defenseless against humans and the predatory animals that came with them. Tuatara populations have decreased greatly since the introduction of Polynesian rats and are now only found on scattered, predator free, offshore islands"

    "About the Area": "The Eastern Himalayan Broadleaf and Conifer Forests blanket the lowlands to the foothills of the Himalayas in northern India, Nepal, and Bhutan.\n\nThis Global ecoregion is made up of 4 terrestrial ecoregions: Eastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests; Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests; Northern Triangle temperate forests; and Northeastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests.\n\nThese middle-elevation forests range from 900 to 3,900 m (3,000 to 13,000 ft) and harbor a tremendous diversity of plant and animal species.\n\nTemperatures vary widely throughout the year making it ideal for broadleaf evergreen trees at the lower elevations, and deciduous trees and conifers higher up. In the sub-alpine zone, above 3,000 meters, forests are slow to regenerate, a fact that makes them especially susceptible to degradation. \n\nThe Eastern Himalayan Broadleaf Forests ecoregion has several ‘floral hotspots’ - lush areas covered with endemic plant species. It contains one of the world’s richest varieties of plants, birds, and mammals. Fifteen protected areas, including several large national parks in Bhutan, extend into this ecoregion, helping to preserve its richness.\n\nThe Tibetan Plateau is so high, vast, cold, and snowy that it is also known as the ‘Roof of the World’ and ‘Land of Snows’.",
    "Local Species": "Eastern Himalayan forests are home to a number of extraordinary mammals such as the highly endangered golden langur (Presbytis bieti), lesser panda (Ailurus fulgens), clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), Himalayan black bear (Selenarctos thibetanus), and the goat antelope called Takin (Budorcas taxicolor).\n\nEndangered endemic plants include many orchid species (Cymbidium whiteae, Paphiopedilum fairrieanum, P. wardii), and maple species such as the Accer oblongumand and Acer hookeri.\n\nThe Broadleaf Forests are home to 500 species of birds, of which 12 live almost nowhere else in the world. These forests constitute an important endemic bird area and support a high diversity of bird species such as the Kashmir flycatcher (Ficedula subrubra), Himalayan quail (Ophrysia superciliosa), Brooks' leaf-warbler (Phylloscopus subviridis), and the Blyth's tragopan (Tragopan blythi). \n\nMore than 200 other species of birds live in the Subalpine Forests, along with 88 species of mammals. Other birds characteristic of this ecoregion include the laughing thrushes (Garrulax spp.) of which there are several dozen species resident in the Eastern Himalayas.",

The takin is the national animal of Bhutan.\n\nTakin stand 110-120 cm at the shoulder and weigh up to 1000 kg. Takin have large muzzles and eyes with noticeably small ears - giving a vaguely cartoonish appearance. They are covered in a thick golden wool which turns black on the under-belly. Both sexes have small horns which run parallel to the skull and then turn upwards in a short point, these are around 30 cm long.\n\nThey eat grass, buds and leaves. Takin are diurnal, active in the day, resting in the heat on particularly sunny days. Takin gather in small herds in winter and herds of up to a hundred individuals in the summer, old males are solitary.\n\nIt is listed as vulnerable by IUCN.",
    "Threats": "Conversion of forest to agriculture land and exploitation of forests for timber, fodder and fuel wood (also used by trekkers and mountaineers) are some of the main threats to biodiversity in this region. Additional threats include charcoal production in some low elevation areas and intensive grazing at higher elevations.\n\nPoaching is also an issue, with musk deer and Asiatic black bears particularly under threat. The musk gland of the former and the gall bladders of the latter are considered valuable medicinal ingredients in some cultures."

Due to the continental climate and a Mediterranean influence to temper the effects of the south asian monsoon, this region is floristically quite distinct from the eastern Himalayas.\n\nThe temperate forests of this ecoregion grow at elevations of 600 to 3,800 metres (1,980 to 12,540 ft) along the western slopes of the Himalayas. The middle elevation forests of the Western Himalayas, including places such as the Palas Valley of Pakistan - the most floristically rich area in Pakistan, contain numerous plant species found nowhere else on Earth.",
    "Local Species": "Characteristic plant species in the region include conifers Blue pine (Pinus wallichiana), Spruce (Picea smithiana), Yew (Taxus wallichiana), and Fir (Abies pindrow); subalpine broadleaved species such as Birch (Betula utilis) and Rhododendron (Rhododendron campanulatum); and endangered endemic plant species such as shrubs Lactuca undulata and Berberis lambertii.\n\nPakistan's Palas Valley is home to some of the world's last populations of western tragopans, a species of arboreal pheasant. Mammals include the endangered snow leopard (Uncia uncia) - severely threatened in this region by hunting, Bengal tigers, Himalayan tahrs, and the blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) that are hunted at night by the snow leopards. Among the many birds are snow geese, Tibetan sand grouse, Himalayan griffons, and rubythroats.\n\nMore than 300 species of birds live in the Broadleaf forests, ranging from warblers to pheasants. 7 species of birds are found here and almost nowhere else in the world: the white-cheeked tit, white-throated tit, spectacled finch, Kashmir flycatcher, Tyler’s leaf-warbler, orange bullfinch, and Kashmir nuthatch. More than 70 other species of mammals live here too.",
    "Featured Species": "Himalayan tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus)\n\nThe Tahr’s body length is about 90-140 cm and it weighs 36-90 kg. The dense, woolly winter coat is reddish to dark brown and has a thick undercoat. With their winter coat, males also grow a long, shaggy mane around the neck and shoulders which extends down the front legs. After the spring moult, the coat is much shorter and lighter in color. The legs are relatively short, and the head is proportionally small. The eyes are large, and the ears are small and pointed. The horns are triangular in cross-section and are found in both sexes. They curve upward, backwards, and then inwards, to a maximum length of 45 cm, and are usually larger in males.\n\nMost active during the early morning and late afternoon, Himalayan tahrs spend the middle of the day resting among rocks and vegetation. Very shy and wary, they are difficult to approach, especially from downhill. When startled, they flee with confidence, speeding sure-footedly across the uneven terrain of their habitat. The Himalayan tahr may migrate down the mountain during the winter, resting in denser cover at lower altitudes. When competing for breeding privileges, males lock horns and attempt to throw each other off balance.\n\nThey are listed as vulnerable by IUCN.",
    "Threats": "The remaining forests of this ecoregion are threatened by increasing logging, conversion of land to agriculture, and fuel collection. Hunting is a popular activity in Pakistan and many people own guns. In addition, people from around the world flock here as pilgrims or tourists. Their presence has spurred ill-planned roads, trails, and hotels. Large-scale collection of the morel mushroom (Morchella esculenta) from the Alpine forests by the local people for export coincides with the breeding season of several pheasants and high altitude mammals"

It is a single mountain range, one of the oldest on Earth, encompassing almost every forest type that occurs in the eastern half of North America, from mixed deciduous forests in the lowlands to spruce-fir forests, similar to boreal forests 1,000 miles to the north.\n\nThe Appalachian mountain range has remained geologically stable since the Paleozoic Era - more than 245 million years ago. More than 158 tree species can be found here, ranking this ecoregion among the highest in North America for plant diversity.",

Among the birds populating the diverse habitats are the black-throated green warbler (Dendroica virens), yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus), yellow-throated vireo (Vireo flavifrons), red-eyed vireo (V. olivaceus), black-throated blue warbler (Dendroica caerulescens), and Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis).\n\nTree species include Tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), Red spruce (Picea rubens), numerous oak species (Quercus spp.), the endemic Fraser fir (Abies fraseri), Balsam fir (A. balsamea), and Allegheny plum (Prunus alleghaniensis). Mammals such as the fisher (Martes pennanti) also roam these forests.",
    "Featured Species": "The Alabama map turtle (Graptemys pulchra) is a medium to large size, with adult males measuring 9-13 cm and females slightly larger at 14-29 cm. This turtle is part of the broad head group of map turtles which derive their name from the pattern of yellow or cream colored markings on their head, neck and legs which look like the markings on a road map. It is mostly a crustacean (mollusk) eater, but will also eat insects and fish. It has a domed shell keel that is exaggerated as a hatchling and slowly wears down with age, especially in old females.\n\nThe Alabama map turtle lives in large sandy/muddy rivers as well as in rocky streams. Juveniles and males prefer brush piles along the sides of the river. Females prefer deeper water and tend to bask a little bit further out into the river. Basking tends to be on large stems of trees instead of small branches",
    "Threats": "Introduction of a non-native fungus has all but eliminated the once dominant American chestnut tree (Castanea dentata). A major threat to Appalachian-Blue Ridge forests is air pollution - a by-product of increased urban development and electric power generation, which can cause acid rain.\n\nThe introduction of exotic diseases and pests, such as gypsy moths, also poses a serious threat to portions of the habitat. More than 95% of Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests have been heavily degraded over the past 200 years. Only a few fragments of old-growth forest remain, most of which are only a few acres in size."

Two nature reserves in the ecoregion, Foping and Changqing, are important in protecting the panda’s habitat in the Qinling Mountains.\n\nAccording to a Chinese saying, ‘the road to Sichuan is harder than the road to heaven’.",
    "Local Species": "The giant panda is the best-known species found here, inhabiting middle elevation forests that support a dense understory of bamboo. Today most of the giant pandas that survive in the wild occur in the Minshan mountain region to the west, but the temperate forests of this region also support good panda habitat.\n\nOther important species that inhabit these forests include the vulnerable clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), Chinese muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi) - a deer that barks like a dog at dusk, China's giant salamander - the world's largest, and the tufted deer (Elaphodus cephalophus).\n\nAmong the endemic bird species are golden pheasant (Chrysolophus pictus), copper pheasant (C. amherstiae), Temminck's tragopan (Tragopan temminkii), and the Reeve's long-tailed pheasant (Syrmaticus reevesi).\n\nShennongjia Mountain is supposedly the home of the yeren, or ‘wild man’, described as a reddish-colored, furry, apelike animal with human features.

    "Featured Species": "The Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus) is the largest salamander in the world, and is fully aquatic. It grows up to 1.8 meters in length, though most individuals found today are considerably smaller. The skin is dark brown, black or greenish in color and irregularly blotched. It is also rough, wrinkled and porous which facilitates respiration through the skin as this large amphibian lacks gills. This species has an elongated body, and 4 legs which are roughly similar in size. The snout is less rounded than that of the related Japanese giant salamander and the tail is a little longer and broader. Both species have tubercles on the head and throat, though their arrangement is different. \n\nThis giant amphibian is generally active at night, when it relies on smell and touch to locate its prey. It lives in muddy, dark rock crevices along riverbanks and feeds on fish, smaller salamanders, worms, insects, crayfish and snails, catching them with a rapid sideways snap of the mouth. It has an extremely slow metabolism and can go for weeks without eating if necessary. During the day it retires beneath rocks. Both the Chinese and Japanese giant salamanders are long lived, with one specimen in captivity living for 52 years.",
    "Threats": "Most natural places have been seriously modified by thousands of years of agriculture and commerce, and decades of heavy industry. The principle threats to this ecoregion include expanding agriculture and increasing demand for timber, both associated with a growing human population.\n\nOver the past two decades, China's transition to a market economy has increased demand for non-timber forests and wildlife products for medicinal and other uses. A logging ban in the mountains of western Sichuan and increased conservation awareness by the government of China are positive signs for the future."

These heavily built birds have legs feathered to the toes. Most species are year-round residents, and do not migrate. These birds are mainly herbivorous, but will also feed on insects, especially when feeding young.\n\nThey are very similar to the North American Spruce Grouse, to which they are closely related. The Siberian grouse mostly occurs in forests of spruce, fir, larch and pine. Their range is far eastern Russia, and a small population formerly inhabited the far north east of China, where they are probably now extinct",
    "Threats": "Conversion to agriculture, deforestation, poaching, urban expansion, mining, and pollution pose serious threats to the ecoregion. The habitats of this ecoregion are protected in many formal reserves, but with Russia’s current economic situation there is not enough funding for proper reserve management.\n\nKurile Islands is one of the richest fishing zones in the world. As a result, moderate levels of fishing have escalated to an uncontrolled plundering of the sea with enormous quantities of crab, shrimp, squid, and sea urchin from the southern Kurile Islands region going directly to Japan."

    "Featured Species": "The Pacific giant salamander, Dicamptodon ensatus, and its close relatives, are the largest of the salamanders that have a terrestrial stage. Adults measure 170 – 305 mm.\n\nGiant salamanders have an interesting life cycle. They lay large clutches of sizable, yolky eggs under rocks in the headwaters of clear water streams. Eggs hatch after a several month incubation into stream-adapted larvae that have well developed limbs, a depressed body, and a tail fin that extends only to the base of the tail. The larvae live for at least 2 and perhaps as long as 4 years. They grow to a large size, some as large as the largest known adults. Occasionally larvae become reproductive, but more typically they metamorphose into the adult form. \n\nDiet is most likely similar to related Pacific giant salamanders that feed on aquatic invertebrates, with a shift towards larger prey items with growth. Pacific giant salamanders have an arched posture and will release toxins when disturbed.",
    "Threats": "Intensive commercial logging has destroyed more than 90% of the native forests of this ecoregion. The immense size of the mighty redwood trees, and the beauty of their wood, has made them a target for loggers for more than a century. Even logging in surrounding watersheds can have severe repercussions for redwood groves, since it can cause severe flooding, fires, and sedimentation. The spread of urban areas between Monterey and San Francisco, along with the introduction of exotic plants into these ancient forests, exacerbate the problems. Cruise ships can lead to pollution, as well as disturbing whales and other marine mammals. Other threats include pollution from pulp mills and mines.\n\nIntroduced beavers are also creating problems for native wildlife. Their damming of small streams is making it difficult for Coho salmon to travel upstream and spawn. Similarly, introduced rats, squirrels, and raccoons have reduced the size of seabird colonies as they prey on eggs and young birds."

    "Habitat Type": "Temperate Coniferous Forests",
    "Geographic Location": "North America: southeastern United States",
    "Conservation Status": "Critical/Endangered",
    "About the Area": "This Global ecoregion is made up of 2 terrestrial ecoregions: Southeastern mixed forests; and Southeastern conifer forests.\n\nIt is the largest coniferous forest ecoregion east of the Mississippi River, spanning the coastal plains of southeastern United States. The biological diversity here is virtually unparalleled in temperate North America, with 190 tree species of which 27 are endemic.\n\nThe Southeastern conifer forests ecoregion is known for the long-leaf (long-needled) pine trees that once dominated the area. These are beautiful trees reaching 18 – 21 meters (60 – 70 ft) into the sky. Their needles are amazingly long - at nearly 45 cm they are the longest pine needles of any Eastern pine. The long-leaf pine wiregrass (Aristida stricta) communities support one of the richest herbaceous floras in the world.",
    "Local Species": "Southeastern mixed forests rank among the top 10 in the United States in terms of number of endemic reptiles, amphibians, butterflies, and mammals. There are more than 3,600 native species of herbs and shrubs, the highest in North America.\n\nComponents of this important fauna include the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), mole skink (Eumeces egregius), Eastern indigo snake (Drymarchon corais), and Apalachicola dusky salamander (Desmognathus apalachicolae). Gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) are important to other animals in the ecoregion because nearly 400 other species use their burrows",
    "Featured Species": "Gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus)\n\nThe Gopher tortoise’s upper shell is brown or tan, with growth rings evident on younger individuals. The under shell is unhinged, dull yellowish in color, with the soft parts grayish brown. The upper shell can range in length from 107 to 240 mm. Compared to the other species in its genus, the gopher tortoise's head is broad, hind feet small, and shell elongate.\n\nIt is an herbivore that enjoys low vegetation. The gopher tortoise spends most of its foraging time grazing in areas with a good supply of grasses and low herbs. Its food primarily consists of grasses and leaves with occasional wild fruits and berries.\n\nThe life of a gopher tortoise revolves around a tunnel-like burrow that is excavated using its shovel-like front feet. Burrows can be up to 12 meters in length and 3 meters in depth. Each burrow has a single opening and the width of the burrow is approximately equal to the length of the tortoise.\n\nTortoise burrows also afford refuge to other animals including the indigo snake, pine snake, gopher frog, Florida mouse, opossum, armadillo, burrowing owl, gopher cricket, scarab beetles, and many others. Some, such as the Florida mouse, cannot exist without the tortoise burrow.",
    "Threats": "As a result of extensive habitat loss and degradation, many species that occur in this region, including many of those native to long-leaf pine forests are now endangered. Virtually all of the long-leaf pine forests have disappeared, either replaced by mixed hardwood forests as a result of fire suppression or converted to farms to grow food or trees for lumber or paper pulp.\n\nHistorically, intensive logging and clearance have destroyed the majority of native communities in the ecoregion. In many areas, the suppression of the natural fire regime has resulted in the conversion of conifer stands to stands of hardwood species, while urban sprawl and development continue to threaten other areas of intact habitat."

Millions of years of isolation have created unique habitats and an abundant number of endemic plant species.\n\nA trek through the Valdivian Temperate Rain Forests will take you through low coastal mountains, across a broad valley, then into the high Andes. Along the way, you'll see rare alerce and monkey puzzle trees and a wide variety of mosses, mushrooms, and lichens. You’ll also see many creatures, including Andean deer and, if you’re lucky, a primitive marsupial. \n\nSnow-capped volcanoes and Andean peaks are the backdrop of these temperate rainforests. The Southern beech forests are 1 of only 3 of this type of forest in the world.\n\nSome people believe that these forests were once part of the ancient Gondwanaland land mass because they more closely resemble forests in Australia and New Zealand than other forests on the South American continent.",
    "Local Species": "Because of the rapid elevation changes, the region is home to many species with specialized habitat requirements. This includes the world's smallest deer, the endangered pudu, South America's largest woodpecker, the Magellanic woodpecker, and 2 pine-seed eating parrots. A fascinating bird, the male Juan Fernández firecrown, an endemic species of hummingbird is found here. It has earned its name from the colors on its crown, which shift from emerald to scarlet, depending on the light.\n\nValdivian temperate forests are very dense, with epiphyte-laden trees reaching up to 46 meters (150 ft) in height. The most abundant trees are Antarctic beech, but many other trees are also present, including the threatened guaitecas cypress, as well as the monkey puzzle tree. These forests are also home to the extraordinarily tall Alerce trees that can reach heights of over 114 meters (375 ft) and live for more than 3,000 years",
    "Featured Species": "The Magellanic woodpecker (Campephilus magellanicus) is 36 - 38 cm (18 in) in length. The species is mainly black, with a white wing patch and a grey, chisel-like beak. Males have a crimson head and crest. Females have a mainly black head, but there is an area of red near the base of the bill. Juvenile Magellanic woodpeckers resemble females of the species, but have a smaller crest and are browner in color. In its range, this bird is unmistakable in appearance.\n\nMagellanic woodpeckers inhabit mature forests, where they feed mainly on grubs and adult beetles. They breed in late fall to early winter, digging a nest cavity 5 – 15 meters above the ground. Females lay 1-4 eggs.\n\nThe most common calls of the Magellanic woodpecker are a nasal ‘keé-yew’ and ‘pi-caá’. Like many woodpecker species, their drum is a loud double knock.",
    "Threats": "Intensive logging and conversion of forests to timber plantations are the major threats to this region. A Chilean forestry company is responsible for 1 of the most devastating examples of forest destruction: In converting rain forest to eucalyptus plantations, the company has already destroyed extensive portions of these fragile forests in violation of Chilean law.\n\nSevere habitat destruction makes the Juan Fernández Islands a critical conservation priority. The 195 introduced and invasive plant groups are displacing local endemics; at least 75% of the remaining native plants are threatened or endangered"

The cool temperatures of these mountain regions make them a better habitat for conifer species than hardwoods.\n\nAppenine forests shield such rare gems as the lady’s slipper, an orchid found in only 2 locations in the central mountains, and the Marsican brown bear, which is seldom seen.\n\nCrimean Submediterranean forest complex links western and eastern Europe and thus harbors a broad range of biodiversity. For example, 2,000 plant species grow in the eastern-most part of the ecoregion - and over 100 of them are endemic.\n\nCzars and other Russian nobility chose the Crimea as their vacation spot as this is a land of spectacular beauty, including montane pine forests, waterfalls, caves, craters, grottoes, and rocky beaches. The forests of the Dinaric Mountains are among the largest and most continuous tracts of forested habitat remaining for large carnivores in Europe.\n\nWith about 3,500 vascular plant species, 64 species of mammals, and hundreds of bird species, the Pyrenees are considered one of the most important hot spots for biodiversity in Europe.",
    "Local Species": "Notable tree species include the Spanish juniper (Juniperus thruifera), Horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum), Balkan pine (Pinus heldreichii), Mediterranean cyprus (Cupressus sempervirens var. sempervirens), and the Atlas cedar (Cedrus atlantica). Among the best-known mammals of this ecoregion are 2 species of chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica and R. rupricapra) - horned, goat-like creatures. The Marocano fir - with its thick, twisted, and forked trunk - is found only in the Rif Mountains of Morocco.\n\nAlpine chamois climb nimbly over steep and rocky areas, while southern chamois favor grassy alpine meadows and low, forested slopes. Other mammals include 2 species of ibex (Capra pyrenaica and C. ibex), wolf (Canis lupis), brown bear (Ursus arctos), European river otter (Lutra lutra), and the Barbary macaque (Macaca sylvanus).\n\nThis region is also home to many birds of prey, including the black vulture (Aegypius monachus), griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus), Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), and a bold and ferocious falcon called the saker (Falco cherrug).\n\nAn unusually high number of amphibians for this latitude are found in the Crimea, as well as many endemic mollusks and insects. It is also rich in endemic plants - between 240 to 300 species can be found.\n\nAbout 4,500 species of vascular plants, 800 species of mosses, 300 liverwort species, 2,500 species of lichens, and more than 5,000 species of fungi are found in the Alps mixed forests as well as about 21 species of amphibians, 15 species of reptiles, hundreds of bird species, and 80 species of mammals.",
    "Featured Species": "The Griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) is 95 - 110 cm long with a 230 - 265 cm wingspan. It is a typical vulture in appearance, with a white bald head, very broad wings and a short tail. It has a white neck ruff and yellow bill. The buff body and wing coverts contrast with the dark flight feathers. It breeds on crags in mountains in southern Europe, North Africa, and Asia, laying 1 egg. Griffons may form loose colonies, possibly mating for life, and does not migrate.\n\nThis species, like other vultures, possesses great powers of flight. Griffon vultures may cruise for 6 or 7 hours covering 100 miles looking for food. When 1 vulture drops to a carcass, others see it and congregate. It is not unusual to have 50 vultures waiting around a kill for a chance to feed. This vulture grunts and hisses at roosts or when feeding on carrion. It feeds its young, not by carrying food to them in its talons, but by disgorging from its maw part of what it had swallowed.",
    "Threats": "Logging, overgrazing, air pollution, acid rain, poaching, predator control, and industrial development provide the greatest threats to this ecoregion. The expansion of towns, villages and trans-alpine communication systems also pose threats to the integrity of habitats. Tourist traffic can be heavy, and visitors have been guilty of over-collecting orchids. Especially along the Crimean coast, tourism has degraded many areas through construction activity, soil compaction, and littering.\n\nMore than 11 million people live in the Alps. The mountains here are popular tourist destinations and are also the site of power plants, industry, and agriculture, all of which contribute to air and water pollution."

Endemism is high throughout - in the Caucasus alone up to 20% of the flora is considered endemic.\n\nCaucasus mixed forests contain a mixture of species from Central and Northern Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa. It also contains a remarkable number of endemic species, including more than 1,500 plants. Two wetlands in Colchida are so important for waterfowl and wetland species that they have been designated as RAMSAR sites - and given official protection. \n\nNorthern Anatolian conifer and deciduous forest is classified as an ‘Important Bird Area’ by Birdlife International because it provides critical habitat for the Dalmatian pelican, purple heron, and black stork. Numerous types of ferns and herbs are among the 2,400 species of plants known to occur in this region.",
    "Local Species": "Selected species of the region include the Caucasian tur (Capra caucasica), maral (Cervus elaphus maral), chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra), red deer (Cervus elaphus), and the Caucasian bison (a subspecies of European bison, Bison bonasus). Predators such as the wolf (Canis lupis), bear (Ursus arctos), lynx (Lynx lynx), and the extremely rare Central Asian leopard (Pantera pardus tullianus) also roam these forests.\n\nTwo birds found here and nowhere else are the Caucasian black grouse (Tetrao mlokosiewiczi), which nests in thickets of rhododendron, juniper, and birch, and the Caucasian snowcocks (Tetraogallus caucasicus), flocks of which can often be seen near mountain goats.\n\nMore than 10,000 plants, 700 vertebrates, and 20,000 invertebrates have been catalogued in the Caucasus Mixed Forests. The Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests together with the swampy broadleaf forests of the Colchic lowland, boast 130 endemic species of plants and animals.",
    "Featured Species": "The west Caucasian tur (Capra caucasica) is a large, heavy-set goat. Males are larger than females in terms of size and weight, and are easily distinguishable in the field by their larger horns. The summer coat of the west Caucasian tur varies from rusty grey to rufous-brown, while in winter the coat dulls to a grayish-brown. The body is massive with a relatively long, deep trunk; the legs are short but strong.\n\nThe diet of Caucasian tur contains over 100 recorded species of plants. Salt licks are visited regularly throughout the year, typically in the evening; herds have been recorded traveling up to 10 km in order to reach mineral sources. They are seasonal breeders; a single kid is the norm, although twins are known. West Caucasian tur vocalize using sharp, intermittent whistling which sounds almost like a high-pitched sneeze. The life span of west Caucasian tur in the wild is not precisely known, but most adult animals die before the age of 10 or 12; on rare occasions, individuals may survive into their 15th or 16th year.\n\nThey are listed by IUCN as vulnerable.",
    "Threats": "Aggressive forestry techniques including clear felling and replanting with alien species, coastal development in narrow coastal strips, overgrazing, recreation, and dam construction in large and small catchments, threaten the integrity of this ecoregion.\n\nAn international consortium, BTC Co., headed by BP, is proposing to build a 1700 km pipeline to convey Caspian crude oil from Baku in Azerbaijan to Ceyhan on the Turkish coast of the Mediterranean. Preliminary construction work for the project commenced in 2003. Without proper planning, such projects could have a devastating impact on the biodiversity of the ecoregion.\n\n67 botanical species of the Kopet Dag Mountains are threatened with extinction, and 15 may already have disappeared. The commercial collection of bulbs is a threat to some native bulb species, including Scilla, Galanthus, Lilium, and Cyclamen. Peat cutting and mining are problematic in certain locations as well."

Gonga Shan, the highest summit at 7,556 meters (2,479 ft) is so steep that the glaciers on its east face tumble down below the tree line before they finally melt. It includes peaks from 1,300 meters to 3,500 - 4,000 meters in elevation in the north-south trending mountain system, which defines the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau.\n\nThis altitudinal zonation gives the region a high degree of habitat complexity and a resulting high biological diversity. A flagship species of this ecoregion is the rare and endangered giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), for which a system of nature reserves has been established. Much of this ecoregion escaped glaciation during ice ages, making it a refuge for many endemic and relict species.\n\nThe Hengduan - which means ‘to transect’, or cut downward - is a complex system of high ridges and deep valleys. Because of its remoteness, the Nujiang forests remain one of the most intact and biologically diverse parts of China. The Gaoligong National Nature Reserve is of great ecological importance. It includes forests that vary from subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests at low elevations to subalpine conifer forests at higher elevations.",
    "Local Species": "Some of the best-known species in this ecoregion are giant panda, and the distantly related red panda (Ailurus fulens). Foremost among the relict plant species is the dawn redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides), which until recently was presumed extinct.\n\nOthers include the Chinese yew (Taxus chinensis), Manglietta (Manglietia fordiana), and Chinese cedar (Cryptomeria fortunei). Many of these plants represent the last vestiges of once widespread vegetation types.\n\nSeveral rare but wide-ranging mammals are found here like the takin (Budorcas taxicolor), Chinese stump-tailed macaque (Macaca thibetana), tufted deer (Elaphodus cephalophus), Indian muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak), jungle cat (Felis chaus), spotted linsang (Prionodon pardicolor), the vulnerable clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), and the Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus).",

The fur is generally sandy brown, reddish or grey, and is unpatterned except for stripes on the legs and occasionally the throat. Due to the pointed ears and the long legs this cat resembles a small lynx (hence the name - swamp lynx). It inhabits various habitats, for instance savannas, tropical dry forests and the reed along rivers and lakes, but it is not found in rainforests. The Jungle Cat lives at heights of up to 2,500 meters, but is more common in the lowlands. They are usually active in the daytime, and return to a den in case of danger or to rest.\n\nThe jungle cat's hunting technique is like that of most other cats, stalking and pouncing. They feed on rats, mice, hares, and can jump high in the air to catch pheasants and other large birds. They will even kill and eat porcupines, deer fawns, snakes and frogs. Those cats living close to bodies of water are able to swim and dive in order to catch fish. During mating season, the male barks, sounding like a large dog.",
    "Threats": "A growing human population and the resulting demand for non-timber forests and wildlife products for medicinal and other uses have proved to be a major threat. Local villagers earn money from tourists by posing in phony ethnic costumes that include pelts of red panda and feathers from Lady Amherst’s pheasant. Merchants in towns all over the region sell bear and leopard parts as folk medicine."

Its outer fur is shiny brown, and it has a dense undercoat. Its body length is 25-35 cm (10-14 in). A solitary dweller, it may live in a burrow in a steep bank or a reed hut built in marshy shallows. \n\nMuskrats do not build dams or fell trees as do beavers; their burrows are constructed above water level and are connected to an underwater entrance by a tunnel. They swim by paddling with the hind feet, using the tail as a rudder. Musk secretions are used with droppings and urine to mark out territories.\n\nThey feed on vegetation and aquatic animals; their chief enemy is the mink. Mating occurs in spring and summer. The gestation period is about 30 days and the female bears several litters of 2 to 6 young each season.",
    "Threats": "Most of the ecoregion is intact but logging has heavily impacted some local watersheds, especially in the riparian habitats. Highway construction and oil pipelines pose additional threats. Timber harvesting is heaviest in riparian spruce and poplar areas, and upland lodgepole pine areas.

    "Local Species": "Dominant tree species include the Siberian spruce (Picea obovata), Siberian larch (L. russica), Larix sukaczewii, and Siberian fir (Abies sibirica).\n\nThere are many examples of Siberian species such as reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) and sable (Martes zibellina), as well as European species such as the hare (Lepus Europaeus), polecat (Mustela putorius), and mink (Mustela lutreola). \n\nMost birds are not specific to the Urals, but may be found in the European or Siberian taigas. These include the Eurasian dipper (Cinclus cinclus), Golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs), Eurasian dotterel (Charadrius morinellus), Northern black grouse (Lyrurus tetrix), and the Ural owl (Strix uralensis).\n\nOnce extinct in this ecoregion, the European beaver was reintroduced in 1949 and has made such a strong comeback that it is now common.",
    "Featured Species": "The sable (Martes zibellina) is a small mammal ranging from about 32 to 50 cm (13 to 20 in) long, excluding the 13–18 cm tail, and weighs 0.9–1.8 kg. Sables are diurnal carnivores, using their sense of smell and hearing to hunt for small prey. They have been observed to hide in their dens for days during periods such as snow storms, or when they are being hunted by humans. In the wild they are potentially vicious \n\nThey are mostly terrestrial, hunting and constructing dens on the forest floor. They feed on chipmunks, squirrels, mice, small birds and fish. When primary sources are scarce they eat berries, vegetation, and pine nuts. The name sable appears to be Slavonic in origin.\n\nThe sable was previously hunted heavily for its fur and is now protected in some regions.",
    "Threats": "Centuries of resource exploitation, logging, mining, processing of metals and chemicals, and heavy industry have caused extensive habitat loss and degradation in some locations.\n\nMountain tundra is significantly altered throughout the ecoregion, except in certain protected areas. Middle and southern-area taiga zones are also heavily altered but northern taiga landscapes are still relatively well preserved."

    "Featured Species": "Kamchatka brown bear (Ursus arctos beringianus)\n\nThese giant bears are very similar to Kodiak bears of Alaska, but tend to be darker. Head and body length is up to 275 cm (9 ft), and shoulder height is 127-135 cm (50-53 in). As with the Alaska brown bear, the Kamchatka brown bear grows large because of its abundant and protein-rich diet of spawning salmon and other fish in the coastal rivers, and from the comparatively mild climate that permits a shorter period of hibernation. It is a very large, dark bear with a massive skull. The forehead is broad and rather steeply elevated over the relatively short nose. The coat is long, dense and soft. The color varies from pale yellow to blackish-brown and dull black, but dark individuals predominate. The claws are dark brown, sometimes with light yellowish streaks at the tips, and are up to 1 cm (4 in) in length. The largest specimens are found in Kamchatka and on the Shantar islands, weighing from 200 – 1,000 kg.",
    "Threats": "Habitats in this region are relatively intact and undeveloped due to low human population density. However, overfishing of salmon and steelhead and mismanagement of fisheries are major threats to the continued survival of these populations and wildlife that depend on them as a food source, such as brown bears. Big-game hunting and poaching of brown bears threaten one of the world's most intact populations of this species. \n\nAn increase in mining, oil exploration and gas drilling is also a potential threat. As in other parts of eastern Russia, fires caused by humans’ damage the region’s forests enormously and lead to the growth of tree species that are different from those originally found here."

These woodlands and nearby grasslands and desert support many endemic dryland plants.\n\nSeveral endemic species are found in the more mesic habitats found along the Jubba and Shabelle, the only permanent rivers in the area.",
    "Local Species": "Birds include Degodi lark (Mirafra degodiensis), short-billed crombec (Sylvietta philippae), and bulo burti bush-shrike (Laniarius liberatus).\n\nMammals endemic to this ecoregion include the African wild ass (Equus africanus somaliensis), Speke's gazelle (Gazella spekei), hirola (Damaliscus hunteri), dibatag (Ammodorcus clarkei), Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi), naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber), and Hunter's hartebeest (Damaliscus hunteri).\n\nAlso seen here is a unique species of hedgehog, known by the Latin name Atelerix sclateri, moving quickly through the night.\n\nEndemic reptiles include Taylor's strange agama (Xenagama taylori), similar agama (Agama persimilis), Atractaspis scorteccii, and Parker's leaf-toed gecko (Hemidactylus megalops).",

It has large incisors which are used to excavate tunnels and to eat. It is 8-9 cm long and weighs 30-80 gms. It lives exclusively in underground tunnels and burrows in semi-arid, grassy regions. Its diet is mainly tubers and roots.\n\nThe naked mole-rat is unusual in that it is the only known mammal to be eusocial (living in a colony like termites and ants) with a caste system. Colonies range from 20 to 300 individuals, with 1 breeding female (the queen) and 1 to 3 breeding males. The colonies inhabit elaborate tunnel systems, with the colony’s workers forming head-to-tail digging chains to tunnel and gather food.",
    "Threats": "Grazing livestock and fuel wood collection pose major problems, particularly near villages and towns. The populations of most endemic and near endemic larger animals have declined dramatically and are very fragmented due to illegal hunting, following decades of political instability and open warfare over large parts of the region.

    "About the Area": "This Global ecoregion is made up of 3 terrestrial ecoregions: Southern Acacia-Commiphora bushlands and thickets; Serengeti volcanic grasslands; Northern Acacia-Commiphora bushlands and thickets.\n\nThese dramatic savanna and grassland complexes are among the most distinctive in the world, with globally outstanding concentrations and diversity of large land mammals. The largely intact rangelands of East African Acacia Savannas support one of the world's most spectacular migration of large mammals. The region experiences a dramatic cycle of seasons with periods of drought alternating with monsoon months.\n\nAs the drought approaches, great numbers of grazing wildebeests and zebras migrate north in search of food. Then, when the rains return, the animals alternate between 2 habitats: the Serengeti and Mara Plains. Predators follow.\n\nThe tsetse fly, which carries sleeping sickness, was once present in the region, but its eradication has now made human settlement possible. The Serengeti Volcanic Grasslands ecoregion has one of the highest concentrations of large mammals in the world. Here you will find more than a million wildebeest, hundreds of thousands of plains zebras, and thousands of Thomson’s gazelles throughout the grasslands.",
    "Local Species": "Species such as giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), African elephant (Loxodonta africana), and more than one million wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) typify the popular image of this ecoregion.\n\nOther mammals known from this area include hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphuscokei) and Grant's gazelle (Gazella granti).\n\nThis ecoregion is also home to tremendous numbers of birds, including a number of species found nowhere else, such as grey-breasted spurfowl (Francolinus rufopictus), Fischer's lovebird (Agapornis fischeri), Karamoja apalis (Apalis karamojae), and rufus-tailed weaver (Histurgops ruficauda).\n\nOther endemic species include the Scheffler's dwarf gecko (Lygdactylus scheffleri) and Mpwapwa worm lizard (Chirindia mpwapwaensis).",
    "Featured Species": "Wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) are large African bovids with robust muzzles and cow-like horns. The horns are long without ridges and the males' horns are thicker. Wildebeests have short hair covering their bodies, and their color ranges from slate gray to dark brown, with males darker than females. There are black vertical stripes of longer hair on their backs. They also have black faces, manes, and tails.\n\nWhen there is enough food for wildebeests to remain relatively sedentary, herds form in the typical fashion of social ungulates: bachelor herds and territorial males with a group of females and offspring. As the dry season deepens, more animals congregate on available grazing lands and thus lose separate herd identities. Wildebeests are continually on the move as they seek favorable supplies of grass and water.\n\nThe famous Serengeti population of wildebeest is a very large nomadic group. Each year around 1 million wildebeest make a migratory circle of 500 to 1,000 miles. Beginning right after the calving season in January and February on the southeastern Serengeti plains, they move west toward Lake Victoria, then turning north into the Maasai Mara. They are relentless in their advance and many are injured, lost (especially calves) or killed. By the end of the dry season, the wildebeest have almost exhausted the grazing lands and return south to the Serengeti plains as the rains begin.",
    "Threats": "This region has many large protected areas, but there are increasing problems with poaching, agriculture, land use conflicts with pastoralists, and uncontrolled trophy hunting. There is also an increased use of unsustainable slash and burn practices by smaller scale farmers, leaving the land infertile. Unsustainable water usage and irrigation practices pose problems for wildlife that rely on a steady supply of water to rivers and water holes.\n\nIn areas where people rely on bushmeat as a major source of protein, populations of ungulates have declined at alarming rates. Most black rhinoceroses in this region have already been killed by trophy hunters and poachers seeking their valuable horns. Even some plant species, such as the African Blackwood, are threatened by over-harvesting because of their commercial value in making carvings for the tourist industry."

In addition, some areas support relatively undisturbed natural communities of these plants and animals. Over 20,000 hartebeest have been recorded in the Selous game reserve.",
    "Local Species": "The word miombo is Bantu for the oak-like trees that characterize these central and eastern African woodlands. Miombo trees grow interdependently with a tree-root fungus that increases their mineral uptake from the soil. Mopane trees can grow to heights of more than 25 meters (80 ft) if the soil is rich, but these adaptable trees can also grow in poorly drained or clay soil.\n\nThese unique woodlands are home to many large mammals, including giraffes, elands, rhinos, and the largest population of African elephants (Loxodonta africana). \n\nAmong the reptiles are endemics such as the Zaire centipede-eater (Aparallactus moeruensis), Platysaurus maculates, Dalophia luluae, carved worm lizard (Monopeltis scalper), and the Katanga beaked snake (Rhinotyphlops kibarae).\n\nBird species such as the black-faced waxbill (Estrilda erythronotos), Miombo rock-thrush (Monticola angolensis), and the Miombo pied barbet (Tricholaema frontata) are also found here.\n\nAn estimated 8,500 plant species grow in the Central woodlands, about half of which are endemic. Rich in reptiles, the region has 46 endemic species.",
    "Featured Species": "The black-faced waxbill (Estrilda erythronotos), part of the family Estrildidae, measures around 13 cm in height and is grey/brown, with a pink throat and black bill and legs. It feeds on the ground or on the wing, mainly on invertebrates and seeds.\n\nBlack-faced waxbills are usually monogamous. Nests are built on the branches of trees or shrubs.",
    "Threats": "Much of the ecoregion remains sparsely settled and the resulting human population pressures are minimal, leaving large areas of the habitat relatively intact. Future population growth and associated activities are a potential threat. Areas surrounding large, urban centers such as Lusaka in Zambia have been cleared for farming, ranching, and charcoal production.\n\nAfrican Blackwood trees are heavily harvested to make musical instruments such as clarinets and piano keys, as well as for traditional and tourist-trade carvings. The hunting of bushmeat is a growing problem in this ecoregion, and hunting for rhino horn and elephant ivory has negatively impacted the population of both species."

Females weigh from 225-275 kg.\n\nDominant males mate with the females in their herd and actively defend access to those females. They are mainly active during the cooler parts of the day, in the morning and evening. Herd sizes generally number 12-15, consisting of the dominant male, females and their young. Roan antelope are grazers that prefer leaves over stems and are never far from a source of water.",
    "Threats": "Significant loss of original wooded savanna habitats has occurred in this ecoregion, but large blocks of relatively intact habitat remain even outside protected areas.\n\nThreats include seasonal shifting cultivation, over-grazing by livestock, logging, burning for charcoal, uncontrolled wild fires, trophy hunting and climatic desiccation. Hunting has depleted populations of large mammals. For example, rhinos once thrived here, but have disappeared due to poaching."

The tail is used as a balance mechanism. Red kangaroos cannot walk, but bounds on its hind legs, reaching speeds of up to 30 mph for short periods. The male red kangaroo is usually a reddish color and the female is bluish-gray. They also have excellent vision and hearing and a highly developed sense of smell which allows them to detect water sources.\n\nThey survive on grass and other vegetation. They are also able to go for long periods without water as long as they have access to green plants. However, in times of drought the population falls significantly. \n\nTraveling in groups called mobs, they tend to be semi-nomadic and are led by a dominant male. These kangaroos generally rest during the midday and forage at night, mainly eating succulent grass shoots, herbs and leaves. Red kangaroos have been recorded living up to 22 years in the wild.",
    "Threats": "The lack of fire management, feral animals and weeds, combine with grazing to pose threats to the biodiversity of this ecoregion. Invasive species such as weeds and cane toads threaten native species. The introduction of the non-native rusa deer has led to the destruction of grasslands.

Its construction flooded approximately 100,000 hectares of land, and destroyed important aquatic habitats, including Guaíra Falls.\n\nA number of additional dams and waterways are planned within the ecoregion that have the potential to effectively block fish migrations. Burning of land for soybean plantations, desertification of the land, agricultural pesticides, and untreated domestic sewage have affected the quality of water as well."

    "Conservation Status": "Vulnerable",
    "About the Area": "The Brazilian Shield is the pre-cambrian geologic formation lying primarily south of the Amazon River. The ancient sedimentary rocks of the Brazilian Shield are well weathered, and the tributaries draining them tend to be nutrient-poor ‘clearwater’ rivers, which appear transparent.\n\nHundreds of rivers and streams flow through this area on their way to the Amazon. Despite the low nutrient content of the water, these rivers are believed to contain exceptional levels of aquatic diversity, with a large number of migratory fish species.\n\nAs the rivers and streams near the Amazon, they swell and pick up speed. At one point, the mighty Madeira River rushes through 320km (200 miles) of deep, swirling rapids.",
    "Local Species": "Along with the Upper Amazon Rivers and Streams, this ecoregion includes species from several fish families.\n\nFish groups with high numbers of species representation include Characins (e.g. tetras, piranhas, pacus), Catfish (e.g. doradids, loricariids, pimelodids), Gymnotoids (‘Electric eels’), Osteoglossids (relic ‘bony-tongues’), and Cichlids. Other aquatic species are also expected to show high levels of diversity.",
    "Featured Species": "Electric Eel (Electrophorus electricus)\n\nThis fish is not a true eel, but a giant member of the knifefish order with an eel-like body. When fully grown, it can be as thick as a human thigh, and is one of the largest freshwater fishes in South America. It has an elongated square body with a flattened head, and an overall dark grayish green colour shifting to yellowish on the bottom. The electric eel can grow up to 2.5m (8.2 ft) in length and weigh up to 20kg (44 lb). It has a continuous fin that runs along its underside, but no fins on its back.\n\nElectric eels have poor eyesight, and find their way by using weak pulses of electricity. However, using modified muscles, or electric organs, that run the entire length of their bodies, they can also produce sudden jolts of up to 600 volts – powerful enough to kill other fishes and potentially lethal to humans, making it a top predator in its range.\n\nJuvenile eels feed on invertebrates, while adult eels feed on fish and small mammals. First-born hatchlings will even prey on other eggs and embryos from later batches.",
    "Threats": "This ecoregion comprises the most altered part of the Amazon basin. Threats include petroleum and mineral exploration, logging, construction of dams, agricultural expansion, and pasture development.\n\nOverexploitation of aquatic species, including hunting of aquatic mammals like the giant river otter pose additional threats."

These 2 families each have only 1 species and can be found only in Africa.\n\nOne of these fish, Phractolaemus ansorgii, has a swim bladder that functions as a lung and permits it to survive in unoxygenated waters by breathing air at the surface.\n\nThe delta also provides habitat for the hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius), the vulnerable pygmy hippo (Choeropsis liberiensis), and West African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis).",
    "Featured Species": "Pygmy Hippo (Choeropsis liberiensis)\n\nPygmy hippos stand about 75cm (30 in) high at the shoulder and weigh 180kg (400lb). At one-fifth of the weight, they are more solitary than their larger relatives and considerably less aquatic. Pygmy hippos have relatively small, less angular heads and narrower feet with fewer webbed toes, all adaptations for spending more time on land. The skin is greenish-black, shading to a creamy gray on the lower body. The average lifespan is 35 years. The gestation period ranges from 190-210 days, and usually a single young is born. \n\nPygmy hippos live either alone or in small groups, typically a mated pair and one calf. Both sexes have home ranges and there are numerous resting places throughout their territories, which they use exclusively when sleeping. They are found in moist to wet terrain. They forage at night, following well-worn trails, and spend the day hidden in swamps. Diet consists of shrubs, ferns and fruit.",
    "Threats": "The delta system is threatened by population growth, coastal urbanisation, oil and gas exploration, industrialisation, domestic and industrial waste discharges, the menace of introduced water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), coastal erosion, and problems associated with aquaculture."

    "About the Area": "Originating at Lake Ngangla Ringco, high on the Tibetan Plateau, the Indus flows more than 3,000km, creating a wide delta of swamps, streams, and extensive mangroves before bursting into the Arabian Sea.\n\nFor much of its course, the river is a wide channel of cloudy water, providing mineral-rich soil and water to its floodplains. The Indus River Delta consists of clay and other infertile soils, and is very swampy. It is an important region for migrating water birds, and is an area rich in freshwater fauna. The delta receives between 25 and 50cm (10-20in) of rain in a normal year. Average temperatures for the delta region in July are 70-85°F and 50-70°F in January.\n\nIt is home to one of the few species of freshwater dolphin worldwide, the Indus River dolphin (Platanista minor) and numerous species of distinctive fish, many of which live in or migrate through the waters of the Indus River Delta.\n\nImportant food species like large freshwater shrimp (Macrobrachium spp.) are part of the abundant aquatic life of the delta.",
    "Local Species": "In addition to Indus River dolphin, the river is home to a number of endemic fish, including Indus baril (Barilius modestus), Indus garua (Clupisoma naziri) and Rita catfish (Rita rita).\n\nSeveral snakehead fishes also live here, including giant snakehead (Channa marulius), which can grow to be 2m (6ft) long and eats fish, frogs, snakes, insects, and earthworms. There are even reports that it will occasionally eat a water bird!\n\nThe Hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha) swims up from the Arabian Sea to spawn in freshwater. This fast swimmer has been clocked covering 71km per day.",
    "Featured Species": "Indus River Dolphin (Platanista minor)\n\nThe Indus River dolphin is one of the world's rarest mammals and most endangered cetaceans. Only about 1,000 of this unique species exist today in the lower reaches of the Indus River. It has a long beak and a stocky body. It has a low triangular hump on its back in place of a 'true' dorsal fin. It is gray-brown in color, sometimes with a pinkish belly. It measures between 1.5 and 2.5m (5-8ft) in length and weighs 80-90 kg.\n\nThe Indus River dolphin is functionally blind having evolved without a crystalline lens or well-developed light-sensitive organ. However, this is not a disadvantage but an adaptation to living in the silt-laden turbid waters of the Indus where eyes are virtually useless, as very little light penetrates below the surface of the murky water.\n\nThis dolphin swims on its side, at times enabling it to swim in water as shallow as 30cm. As it swims on its side, it trails a flipper along the bottom of the river. After 30 to 60 seconds, when it needs to breath, it swims to the surface, rotates upright to take in the air, and then rotates thorough 90 degrees again as it swims back to the bottom.\n\nNumbers have dramatically declined since the construction of the irrigation system in the Indus. Most now remain in a 1,200km stretch of the Indus River.",
    "Threats": "Dams on the river reduce flows in lower portions of the system and limit the transport of fertile sediments downstream into the delta. They also pose a serious threat to the survival of the Indus River dolphin, as the remaining dolphins become isolated into smaller groups.\n\nWater extraction for irrigation, runoff of chemicals into the rivers, and introduced species also threaten the freshwater species of the delta."

The Volga River starts in the Valday Hills of northwestern Russia and flows 3,700km (2,300 miles) before creating this delta and pouring into the Caspian Sea. The delta covers an area of 27,224km² and is approximately 160km across.\n\nThe delta lies in the arid climate zone, characterized by very little rainfall - less than 3cm annually. Water entering the Volga delta separates into more than 500 channels, arms, and rivulets and spreads out onto the adjacent floodplain forming shallow lakes. These flows also carry many nutrients from upstream into the delta making it one of the world's most productive areas for fish, particularly sturgeon.\n\nThe delta also contains oil deposits where millennia of carbon-rich mud have piled until pressure and heat converted the organic material in the lowest layers into petroleum.",
    "Local Species": "About 400 vertebrates, including 127 species of fish and 260 species of birds (including swans, ducks, herons, terns, and ibis), as well as 850 aquatic invertebrates, 430 different plants, and more than a thousand species of insects can be found in the delta.\n\nSturgeon species found in the delta are the Russian (Acipenser gueldenstaedti), Beluga (Huso huso), sterlet (A. ruthenus), and stellate (A. stellatus) sturgeons, in addition to migratory species such as whitefish (Salmonidae) and herrings (Clupeidae). White-eyed bream (Abramis sapa) and the endemic Volga lamprey (Caspiomyzon wagneri) are some of the rare fishes found in this ecoregion.\n\nThe ecoregion has the distinction of being named a Wetland of International Importance because it provides habitat for many migratory birds. Among the unusual birds found here are the Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus), great white egret (Egretta alba), and penduline tit (Remiz penduculinus).",
    "Featured Species": "The Volga bream (spawning population) varies in length from 17-49cm and weighs 170- 2,060g. It inhabits 3 types of water bodies during its life span: rivers, delta-front of the Volga River, and shallow areas of the Caspian Sea. It spawns at the low floodplains during spring flood season and feeds in the delta-front and sea. The most abundant are populations in the Volga and Ural Rivers. Freshwater forms also exist as well. \n\nThe Volga bream occurs at feeding grounds of water salinity up to 14%. Its diet consists of mollusks, crustaceans, worms, Chironomidae, plants, sediment and insects. Eggs are deposited on aquatic plants as well as on drifting remains of aquatic vegetation. Due to their adhesive membrane, eggs stick to plants. Typical spawning sites are temporarily flooded water bodies, low-floodplains and lakes.",
    "Threats": "Dams upstream have altered the natural flow regime of the river thus negatively affecting the productivity of the delta and its fauna. Planned impoundments, water diversions, industrial, agricultural, and domestic pollution further threaten the health of populations dependent upon the delta ecosystem. Cyanobacterial blooms and deoxygentation have increased in recent years."

The head pattern is strong with whitish supercilium and contrasting dark eyestripe. The Basra reed warbler breeds in the Mesopotamian marshes of south-east Iraq.\n\nThe Basra reed warbler is found in aquatic vegetation in or around shallow fresh or brackish water, still or flowing, mostly in large, dense reedbeds. It is found in thickets and bushland on migration and when wintering. It occurs mostly singly or in pairs, but during migration it has been recorded in loose groups.\n\nIt was listed as endangered on the 2004 IUCN Red List, due to an 80% decrease in the species' breeding population - largely a consequence of the draining of the Mesopotamian marshes by former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Efforts are now underway to restore habitat vital to the future conservation of the species.",
    "Threats": "Channelisation, damming, water withdrawals, salinisation from agriculture, oil production activities, hunting, and drainage schemes have destroyed large parts of the wetland complex.\n\nMuch of the fighting during the prolonged Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988) and bombings during the Persian Gulf War occurred in and around the wetlands causing considerable damage to the marsh ecosystems. The drying of the marshes lead to the disappearance of the salt-tolerant vegetation, the plankton rich waters that fertilized surrounding soils, 52 native fish species, the wild boar, red fox, buffalo and water birds of the marsh habitat."

It is the 2nd largest wetland in Europe and the largest reedbed in the world. It provides a unique habitat of canals, reed beds, lakes, and ponds. The delta is still growing as it extends farther into the Black Sea at a rate of 24m per year.\n\nDuring its 2,800km (1,780 mile) course, the Danube River runs through cities, valleys, and deep, wide gorges. Just before the Danube pours into the Black Sea, it splits into three branches, the Chilia, Sulina, and Sfântu Gheorghe.\n\nThe Danube delta provides a critical refuge for several globally threatened species. It is home to about 330 bird species, including 70% of the world’s white pelican population and 60% of the world’s pygmy cormorants.

At its mouth into the Laptev Sea in northern Siberia, the river forms a huge delta of 32,000 sq km, which is the largest Arctic delta and the most extensive protected wilderness area in Russia. \n\nThe Lena River and delta are host to many nature reserves, including the Lena Pillars, Beloozersky, Belyanka, Muna, Ust-Viluisky, Lena Delta Nature Reserve, and Ust-Lensky nature reserve. There is also an International Biology Station - Lena-Nordenskiöld - on the Bykovskaya channel. The whole of the Lena Delta area has been nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.",
    "Local Species": "The wet tundra in the delta, which floods each spring, is an important area for nesting and migrating birds, and also supports a rich fish population. There are 92 planktonic species, 57 benthic species, and 38 species of fish in the river. Sturgeon, burbot, chum salmon, Coregonus autumnalis (cisco), Stenodus leucychthis (nelma), and C. albula are the most commercially important fish.\n\nThis arctic ecoregion experiences 7 months of winter before the snow-covered tundra transforms into fertile wetlands. Swans, divers, geese, ducks, plovers, sandpipers, snipes, phalaropes, terns, skuas, birds of prey, passerines and gulls are just some of the migratory birds that breed in the productive wetland that also supports abundant populations of fish and 5 marine mammals.\n\nSome scientists think that fish of the genus Coregonus, called ciscos, originated here. Spawning fish reported from the delta include the Arctic lamprey (Lethenteron japonicum), burbot (Lota lota), and Arctic cisco (Coregonus autumnalis). Several species of ciscos (Coregonus spp.) are also found in the delta, including C. tugun, C. sardinella, C. peled, C. muskun, and C. nasus.\n\nA few of the many birds that visit or breed in the delta are black brant (Branta bernicla), common and Steller's eiders (Somateria mollissima and Polysticta stelleri), Sabine's and Ross's gulls (Xema sabini and Rhodostethia rosea), and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus)",

Average length is 13-16cm. The dorsal fins arise far back on body, the anterior dorsal lower than the posterior, the fins higher in males. The lower lobe of caudal fin is somewhat larger than upper, the fin joined to both dorsal and anal fins. The anal fin is small, in males represented only by a low ridge. Colour ranges from brown to olive to grayish above, paler below.\n\nIts life cycle consists of a lengthy larval stage followed by metamorphosis in which the lamprey develops eyes and teeth. It then migrates to sea to feed by attaching parasitically to various species of fish. The Arctic lamprey prefers sites with stony or sandy bottoms, shaded by riparian vegetation. It feeds on small aquatic invertebrates, algae and organic matter contained in detritus.",
    "Threats": "The Lena Delta Reserve was expanded in 1995, making it the largest protected area in Russia (61,000km2). However, overfishing, particularly of cisco populations is a concern.

It has a ten foot leap. \n\nDespite their enormous size as adults, eggs and tadpoles of goliath frogs are about the same size as those of other frogs. Like many other species that are the largest members of an evolutionary group, goliath frogs have a very small range. They're found only in a few swift-moving rivers that wind through a fringe of dense rain forest in coastal sections of Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea in western Africa.\n\nThey are prized as food by the Bayele, a tribe of pygmies, who also value their thigh bones for their presumed power to bring good luck. Formerly much sought after by zoological parks, the goliath frog is now protected by law\n\nGoliath frogs don't breed or survive well in captivity. The only real hope for their survival is the preservation of wild populations.",

    "Geographic Location": "South Africa",
    "Conservation Status": "Critical/Endangered",
    "About the Area": "The Cape Rivers and Streams start in the Cape Fold Mountains, and are known for supporting a highly distinctive aquatic biota, exhibiting high levels of endemsim. The many rivers and streams in the ecoregion flow down toward the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, nourishing valleys along the way.\n\nThe range lies within one of the world's six \"floral kingdoms\" - Fynbos, where thousands of different plants grow in a small area. As the plants in the fynbos decompose, they release chemicals that subsequently make the waters of the Cape Fold ecoregion acidic and stain the water to a dark color.\n\nAn extremely important function of rivers is to provide nutrient-laden sediments which are essential for the functioning of coastal ecosystems and for floodplain agriculture.\n\nAmong the goods and services provided by rivers are habitats for many plants and animals, which include many economically important species - fish like bass and trout (even though these are non-indigenous and their presence creates ecological problems of their own); plants such as reeds (Typha), waterblommetjies, arum lilies and some medicinal plants; and sand and cobblestones used in construction and landscaping.",
    "Local Species": "The Cape is home to two near-endemic fish genera, Austroglanis (two species) and Pseudobarbus (six species). Of biogeographic interest is the presence of Cape galaxias (Galaxius zebratus), the distribution of the Galaxiidae family in Australia, Africa, and South America gives clear evidence for continental drift.\n\nStreams and their associated wetlands and springs provide important habitat for a number of endangered or otherwise sensitive amphibian species such as the endangered Hewitt's ghost frog (Heleophryne hewitti), rose's toadlet (Capensibufo rosei), cape caco (Cacosternum capense), the endangered table mountain ghost frog (H. rosei), and the micro frog (Microbatrachella capensis).",
    "Featured Species": "Ghost frogs (Heleophrynidae)\n\nThe common name of \"ghost frogs\" may have been coined because of their occurrence in Skeleton Gorge in South Africa.\n\nThey are medium-sized frogs with triangular discs on the fingers and toes. The size is 1.4–2.6 in (35–65 mm). The body is flattened with protruding eyes, and the limbs are thin and long. The pupil is vertical, the tongue is disc-shaped, and the upper jaw bears teeth. The frogs swim well, with toes that are nearly fully webbed in some species. Most species have large dark spots on a paler background. \n\nAdults are found in forest or riverine forest. These frogs take a range of insects, arthropods, and snails. They readily eat smaller species of frogs.",
    "Threats": "Water is in great demand in this dry ecoregion, with both urban and agricultural uses competing with the needs of the unique aquatic fauna, also causing pollution.\n\nThe construction of dams and interbasin water transfers alter the natural flow regime and block species movements. Introduced species, particularly North American gamefishes such as Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and Smallmouth bass (M. dolomieu) have heavily impacted indigenous species.\n\nOf the 19 indigenous fish in the fynbos system, 16 are endemic - meaning they occur naturally nowhere else on Earth - and 15 are already highly threatened because of loss of habitat; the building of dams and weirs; channel modification through bulldozing; the presence of invasive alien vegetation like eichornia (water hyacinth), parrot's feather and black wattles; and the introduction of alien fish like bass, carp and trout."

Eggs adhere to water plants and hatching occurs around 9 to 12 days at temperatures between 24 to 28° Celsius. Essentially a carnivore, their natural diet consists of terrestrial insects, small aquatic crustaceans, and insect larvae. Aquatic algae, plant pollens, and small pulpy seeds are also ingested.",
    "Threats": "Deforestation as a result of commercial agriculture and industrial logging, which leads to increased erosion and altered hydrologic regimes, poses one of the most significant threats.\n\nRoad building in association with logging has opened up new lands to shifting agriculture. Pollution from mining, industrial logging, agricultural processing, and urban sewage is a serious problem.\n\nExotics such as Tilapia (Oreochromis mossambica) and Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), whose population is growing rapidly, place additional stresses; overfishing for both for subsistence use and the commercial trade, threatens native species.\n\nAdditionally, wildlife trade threatens reptiles such as the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) - heavily hunted in the Sepik River region and elsewhere for its skins and live export."

Where the water is clear and it's not too deep algae eating fishes such as Crossocheilus and Balitorids become more common. Clown loaches and Bala sharks are examples of common aquarium species found in these environments.\n\nEndemic freshwater fish include several shark catfish of the Pangasius genus, several Bettas (Betta spp.), 4 species of hillstream Loaches (Protomyzon spp.), and Tapah (Wallago maculatus). Also present is the endangered Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus).",
    "Featured Species": "Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus)\n\nAsian arowanas grow up to 90 cm (35 in) total length. They have long bodies; large pectoral fins; dorsal and anal fins located far back on the body. These mouthbrooding carnivores have paired barbels on the end of the lower jaw.\n\nAsian arowana scales are large and, in some species, metallic colored, with a distinctive network of raised ribs. They inhabit blackwater rivers, slow-moving waters flowing through forested swamps and wetlands. Adults are piscivorous, with juveniles feeding on insects.\n\nAll species of arowanas are paternal mouthbrooders. Slow to reach sexual maturity, they are difficult to breed in captivity. Asian arowanas are considered \"lucky\" fish by many people, particularly those from Asian cultures.",
    "Threats": "Deforestation, conversion to agriculture, overfishing, exotics, the aquaculture industry, and mining pollution threaten these habitats and their native species. Proposed hydropower dams on high-gradient streams would jeopardize the natural flow regime and species movements."

They are home to such colorfully named fish as the Pygmy Madtom (the world's smallest catfish), the Halloween Darter, and mussels like the Tennessee Heelsplitter and the Purple Wartyback.\n\nIt is home to hundreds of species of fish, snails, mussels and other invertebrates. Within the Roanoke River basin alone, more than 200 fish species are found, of which six are endemic.\n\nOne of few natural lakes in the Southeast United States, Lake Waccamaw was likely formed by a meteoric impact and harbours several endemic fish - a highly unusual evolutionary phenomenon",
    "Local Species": "Of the roughly 400 species of crayfish in the United States, about 70 percent are found only in Southeastern Rivers and Streams. A relatively intact stream in this region supports more mussel species than all of Australia and Europe combined. In just one river, the Cahaba in Alabama, there are more fish species per kilometer than any other river in North America, including 18 species that exist nowhere else.\n\nFish species include local endemics such as Waccamaw silverside (Menidia extensa), Waccamaw killifish (Fundulus waccamensis), and Waccamaw darter (Etheostoma perlongum).\n\nNumerous other fishes found in the ecoregions streams include Cyprinids - e.g, fieryback shiner (Cyprinella pyrrohmela), Redlip shiner (Notropis chiliticus), Blackmouth shiner (Notropis melanostomus), Blacktip shiner (Lythrurus atrapiculus).\n\nAnd, Darters such as, Choctawhatchee darter (E. davisoni), Southern logperch (Percina autroperca), Florida sand darter (Etheostoma bifascia), Okaloosa darter (E. okaloosae); Suckers like, greater Jumprock (Moxostoma lachneri), Grayfin redhorse (Moxostoma sp.); and larger species like Alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula).\n\nAquatic species other than fish include the Mabee's salamander (Ambystoma mabeei), Dwarf waterdog (Necturus punctatus), Neuse River waterdog (N. lewisi), Ringed map turtle (Graptemys oculifera), Everglades's crayfish (Procambarus alleni), and Florida applesnail (Pomacea paludosa).",

It has internal fertilization and probably lays eggs in the spring.\n\nThe Dwarf Waterdog is completely aquatic. It is an opportunistic feeder and will eat crayfish, aquatic insects, and worms. It is found where leaves and similar debris cover the bottom, in black-water and slow-moving streams, swamps, flooded fields, and irrigation ditches. There are no truly conspicuous markings that aid in diagnosis. In general, the coloration is gray to blue to brown to black with small nondescript spots.\n\nThe Dwarf Waterdog has obvious external gills, and has four toes on each foot. It has internal fertilization and probably lays eggs in the spring. It is found from the Atlantic Coastal Plain to the Fall Line and west throughout the Altamaha River drainage.",
    "Threats": "This ecoregion is in one of the most highly populated areas in the United States, and it is rapidly growing. Despite the fact that this is a well-watered region, humans are competing with aquatic species for water. Interbasin water transfers and dams are prevalent, and new projects being planned. Aquatic habitats are further modified through widespread channelisation.\n\nPollution from acid rain, deforestation, roads, agriculture, urbanisation, and industrialisation places additional stresses on native species. Introduction of non-native species like Asiatic clam (Corbicula fluminea) and Zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) threaten native mussel populations, and exotic fish pose similar threats to native fish."

Important not only as a spectacular natural phenomenon, this migration also helps the transfer of nutrients from marine to freshwater environments.\n\nHowever, introduced species threaten native fish and invertebrates; of the present-day fish fauna in the region, nearly 40 per cent may be introduced species, most from eastern North America.",
    "Local Species": "The most prominent migrating species are salmon, including Pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), Chum (O. keta), Chinook (O. tshawytscha), Coho (O. kisutch), and Sockeye (O. nerka).

Fins plain, reddish in males; 8 dorsal fin rays, origin behind pelvic fin insertion; 8 anal fin rays; caudal fin moderately forked. Habitat Clear, deep pools over sand and rocks in creeks, rivers, and lakes.\n\nThis fish was once considered a major predator of young salmons, but while both fishes may compete for food and space, most waters inhabited by Sacramento Squawfish are too warm for young salmons and trouts.",
    "Threats": "Logging, introduced species, water diversion, and impoundments have resulted in serious problems like siltation, increased water temperatures, altered flow regimes, and disruption of fish migration routes. In addition, there is growing concern that warming ocean temperatures may adversely affect migrating salmonids during the oceanic portion of their life cycle.\n\nAnadromous fish (those that migrate from freshwater to the ocean and back to freshwater) have suffered great losses in the face of huge changes to their habitats over the last 100 years. For example, coho salmon in California are at less than 5 percent of their historic numbers."

It has four barbels located in front of its large, wide and toothless mouth, located on the bottom (ventral) side of its head. It has no scales, but \"scutes\" along its body for protection.\n\nThe white sturgeon is a slow growing, late maturing anadromous fish. White sturgeon spawn in large rivers in the spring and summer months and remain in fresh water while young. Young white sturgeon primarily feed on algae and aquatic insects while remaining in rivers and estuarine environments. White sturgeon primarily feed on fish, shellfish, crayfish, and on various aquatic invertebrates, clams, amphipods, and shrimp.",
    "Threats": "Destructive logging practices are the largest and the most extensive threat.

    "Conservation Status": "Relatively Stable/Intact",
    "About the Area": "The Guianan Region of South America is a unique and very special part of our planet, and ranks as one of the world’s last great wild places. Occupying roughly the northeastern third of Amazonia, it is particularly noteworthy for its endemism, unique ecosystems, and exceptionally pristine state, as well as for its cultural diversity. The coastal rivers of this ecoregion drain an area called the Guyana Shield and contain a wide range of flowing water habitats that include cataracts, rapids, and riparian flooded forests among others.\nThough poorly investigated, these rivers are known to support a very diverse, highly intact, and notably endemic freshwater fauna.\n\nThe tallest waterfall in the world - the 3,200 feet (980 m) Angel Falls - is in this ecoregion along with some of the Earth's oldest land formations. In many rivers, waterfalls have created isolated bodies of water, where many endemic species have evolved.\n\nThis region may account for as much as 10-15% of the world’s freshwater, and has the largest number of pristine or near pristine river basins on Earth It also harbors large stocks of carbon in the living biomass of the forest, accounting for about a quarter of the total carbon pool in tropical forests.\n\nThe Orinoco river flows 2140 km across Colombia and Venezuela from its source in the extreme south of the Guianan massif until reaching the ocean, covering an area from the Andes to the Atlantic. The river basin represents one of the most biologically and hydrologically diverse areas of the planet.",
    "Local Species": "The biodiversity of this region is particularly rich, with an estimated 20,000 vascular plant species, of which about 35% (7,000) are endemic, making it one of the three richest tropical wilderness areas on Earth. Bird richness is estimated at 975 species, with 150 endemics and 25 near-endemics; mammals at 282 species, with 27 endemics, reptiles at 280 species, with 76 endemics, amphibians at 272 species, with 127 endemics, and freshwater fish at 2200 species, with 700 endemics. \n\nInvertebrate groups for which numbers are available include the ants, with 900 described species and 1,500 expected, of which 300 are endemic; termites with 150 described species and 225 expected, of which 10 are endemic; earthworms with 120 described species and 2,000 expected, of which 1,900 are likely to be endemic; dragonflies with 210 described species and 240 expected, of which 2 are endemic; moths with 95 species, of which 16 are endemic; stingless bees with 70 described species and 90 expected, of which 10 are endemic; and social wasps with 200 described species and 250 expected, of which 10 are endemic.\n\nAmong the numerous species found in this important freshwater system are the imperiled Arapaima (Arapaima gigas), giant South American river turtle (Podocnemis expansa), Black caiman (Melanosuchus niger), and Arowana (Osteoglossum bicirrhosum). \n\nThis ecoregion provides some of the best remaining habitat for Giant river otter (Pteronura brasiliensis).",
    "Featured Species": "Giant South American river turtle (Podocnemis expansa)\n\nThe giant South American turtle is the largest river turtle in South America. It has a broad, domed and streamlined carapace for active swimming in moderate river currents. The colour may be influenced by the algae that is attached to it, but is usually olive green to brown in colour.\n\nIt nests during the low water season, laying from 75 to 125 leathery eggs per clutch. This species is mainly herbivorous, feeding on aquatic vegetation and plant matter that falls into the water. However, it is also known to be somewhat opportunistic, feeding on small, slow-moving prey and carrion.\nMutual cleaning behaviour between individuals of this species has been observed. One turtle will position itself at right angles to a second turtle and use its jaws to pull algae from its shell. The turtles will then switch position.",
    "Threats": "Unsustainable logging, poor mining practices, and hydroelectric projects have already impacted significant areas and could increase dramatically in the next few years. Monoculture agriculture (e.g., oil palm, soybeans) of the kind that has transformed large areas of Africa, southeast Asia and the Cerrado region of Brazil is another potential threat. Bushmeat hunting and wildlife trade are also problems.\n\nThe freshwater habitats of this ecoregion are relatively intact and support generally stable freshwater populations. However, valuable game species such as the enormous arapaima and some reptiles are imperiled as a result of over-exploitation and illegal border trade.\n\nFurther human activities such as deforestation, mining, agriculture, industrial and domestic waste discharge, and water extraction have led to serious problems such as erosion, sedimentation, cyanide spills, altered hydrologic regimes, pollution, and wildfires."

    "Local Species": "The family Poecillidae, with 5 genera and over 40 fish species, dominates the fish fauna. 7 species of freshwater crabs from 1 genus are endemic to Cuba.\n\nCharacteristic native Antillean freshwater fishes include the Cuban gar (Attractosteus tristoechus), Hispaniolan gambusia (Gambusia hispaniolae), Green rivulus (Rivuluscy lindraceus), and Hispaniola pupfish (Cyprinodon bondi).\n\nThe most threatened New World crocodile, Crocodylus rhombifer, survives in the Zapata Swamp, located in southwestern Cuba. The widespread American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) also occurs in this ecoregion.",
    "Featured Species": "New World crocodile (Crocodylus rhombifer)\n\nCrocodylus is derived from the Greek krokodeilos which means literally \"pebble worm\" and rhombifer apparently refers to the shape of flank scales.\n\nIt is a medium-sized crocodile, reaching 3.5 m in length (although 5 m individuals have been reported) - slightly smaller than C. acutus. Head is short and broad, and a bony ridge is present behind eyes. Scales forming the dorsal shield (across the back) extend onto the back of the neck, and scales on the legs are unusually large, and heavily keeled on the rear legs.\n\nJuveniles possess eyes with a light iris, which is reported to become darker with age. A characteristic yellow and black patterning has led to the name 'Pearly' crocodile. Its diet is mainly fish and chelonia, with the occasional small mammal.",
    "Threats": "Clearing of forests and conversion of land to agriculture are major threats to the integrity of the freshwater systems of the islands.

    "About the Area": "Much of southern Europe escaped glaciation thousands of years ago and hence diversity within water bodies tends to be higher here, than in northern Europe. In addition, the soft limestone that the Balkans are built of, allow water that seeps underground to create subterranean karst channels where many aquatic species live.\n\nThe ridge of the Balkan Range is the main watershed between the Black Sea and the Aegean. The deep karst bedrock provides a steady outflow of the underground aquifer feeding those rivers, and the sprawling old forests retain the topsoil moisture. The riverbeds are steep, the rivers are fast and abundant in water.\n\nAt many places these rivers jump off high cliffs, forming scenic waterfalls, which the local population calls praskala, or spray gushers. Central Balkan is the scene of some of the highest and most impressive waterfalls in Bulgaria, notably Raiskoto Praskalo (124.5 m.), Vidimskoto Praskalo (80 m.) and Kademliiskoto Praskalo (72 m.). \n\nThe Balkans region hosts an extremely diverse and highly endemic (both at a local and regional level) gastropod fauna (snail species), with about 200 known species. For example, the Sava River alone harbours 103 species, of which 54 are endemic. Many endemic fish species and genera are also present in the ecoregion.",

It is a short-lived, freshwater non-parasitic lamprey that lives in shallow, clear, fairly fast-flowing brooks with gravelly substrate, some rocks and aquatic plants.\n\nAmmocoetes larvae are filter feeders on microorganisms, including green algae. Reproduction takes place in January and May. Its existence is threatened by pollution and water obstruction.",
    "Threats": "The aftermath of recent conflicts in this region includes large-scale movements of refugees across the region and pollution and fires originating from bombed industrial sources. Other threats comprise agricultural and industrial waste, untreated sewage effluents, and construction of dams.\n\nThe ecoregion also includes a large number of introduced species that are believed to have negatively impacted native species. For example, hybridisation of the rare Marbled trout (Salmo marmoratus) with the introduced Brown trout (S. trutta) has reduced the genetic integrity of the native species."

This freshwater area supports a high fish diversity and globally outstanding populations of salmon and sturgeon.\n\nThe mighty Amur river flows for nearly 1,900 miles (3,000 km) from the mountains and down through forests before pouring into the Tartar Strait. When the seasons change in the Russian Far East, the Amur can be hard to recognize. During the summer, monsoon rains flood parts of the river. But for six months in the winter and spring, large portions of the Amur are frozen.",
    "Local Species": "The Amur River supports more fish species than any other Russian river with over 120 species. Mollusks and crustaceans are especially diverse, comprising a special Far East complex.\n\nIn addition, the ecoregion contains some of Asia's most extensive temperate reedbeds and wet meadows. These wetlands support a rich bird fauna, including endangered cranes, along with some endemic and rare plant species.\n\nSturgeons and migratory salmon include Amur (Acipenser schrenckii), Sakhalin (A. mikadoi) and Kaluga (Huso dauricus) sturgeon, and Chum (Oncorhynchus keta) and Pink (O. gorbuscha) salmon. The threatened Red-crowned (Grus japonensis) and White-naped (G. vipio) cranes are protected in wetland reserves adjacent to the Amur River.\n\nOther inhabitants include soft-skinned Far Eastern turtle (Amyda sinensis), Ussuri soft-shelled turtle (Trionyx sinensis), Amur pike (Esox reichertii), Amur whitefish (Coregonus ussuriensis), the mussel - Middendorffinaia ussuriensis, and Long-tailed clawed salamander (Onychodactylus fischeri).",
    "Featured Species": "Salamander\n\nThe word \"salamander\" is the name for an entire group, or scientific order, of amphibians that have tails as adults. They have moist, smooth skin like frogs, and long tails like lizards. Most salamanders are small, and few species are more than 6 inches (15 centimeters) long. Their heads are narrow and they have small eyes.\n\nA salamander’s hind legs grow more slowly than its front legs. All four legs on a salamander are so short that its belly drags on the ground. Since salamanders need to stay cool and moist to survive, those that live on land are found in shady forested areas. They spend most of their time staying out of the sun under rocks and logs, up in trees, or in burrows they’ve dug in the damp earth.\n\nAll salamanders are carnivores, but they are seldom in a hurry to catch their meals. Because they move more slowly than other meat eaters, salamanders tend to eat slow-moving, soft-bodied creatures such as earthworms, slugs, and snails. Larger species may eat fish, crayfish, and small mammals such as mice and shrews.",
    "Threats": "Fishing pressure in parts of this ecoregion is intense, including poaching of salmon on breeding grounds for roe, and drift netting for salmon in international waters.

The species radiations of cichlids in the Rift Valley lakes rival radiations of terrestrial fauna in the Galápagos and serve as a classic example of evolutionary adaptation.",
    "Local Species": "The Rift Valley lakes are primarily known for the extensive radiations of fish species in the family Cichlidae. Endemic species of the Clariidae, Claroteidae, Mochokidae, Poecilidae, Mastacembelidae, Centropomidae, Cyprinidae, Clupeidae and other families are also found in these lakes.\n\nA unique pelagic fish community has evolved in Lake Tanganyika including two endemic clupeids, Limnothrissa miodon and Stolothrissa tanganicae, that feed on zooplankton in the pelagic zone and, in turn, provide food for the four predatory centropomids, Lates angustifrons, L. mariae, L. microlepis, and L. stappersii.\n\nLarge numbers of cichlid species live adjacent to one another along the edges of the lakes. For example, one researcher caught 7,000 fish representing 38 families in one 4,300 square foot (400 sq. m) sampling area in Lake Tanganyika.\n\nThe cichlids have evolved specialisations to take advantage of their environment and to limit competition for resources. For example, one unusual group of fish, the scale-eaters, feed exclusively on the scales of other fish.\n\nMost cichlids spend a lot of time caring for their young, but the young of mouth-brooders swim into their parent's mouth for protection in the face of imminent danger. It is not only the fish that are unique to these lakes.\n\nCopepods, ostracods, shrimps, crabs, and mollusks are also represented by high numbers of endemic species.

Snout broad with tapering sides, not concave when viewed from above. It has a large air bladder which is responsible for its ability to move great vertical distances.\n\nForms large schools. Mainly nocturnal and feeds on plankton (especially atyid shrimps, also copepods, prawns), but larger individuals take larval Stolothrissa. Cannibalism does occur. Breeds close to shore throughout the rainy seasons, but with peaks in May to June and December to January.",
    "Threats": "Deforestation as a result of commercial agriculture and industrial logging, which leads to increased erosion and altered hydrologic regimes, poses one of the most significant threats. Road building in association with logging has opened up new lands to shifting agriculture. Pollution from mining, industrial logging, agricultural processing, and urban sewage is a serious problem.\n\nExotics such as Tilapia (Oreochromis mossambica) and Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), whose population is growing rapidly, place additional stresses; overfishing both for subsistence use and the commercial trade, threatens native species.

    "Geographic Location": "Central Asia: Eastern Russia",
    "Conservation Status": "Vulnerable",
    "About the Area": "Due to 25 million years of isolation and a diversity of deep-water habitats, the biodiversity of Lake Baikal - the deepest lake in the world - is unrivaled. It is so large that it has been called an inland sea. Lake Baikal is located in the south of Eastern Siberia, in the Buryat Autonomous Republic and the Region of Irkutsk, Russia.\n\nIt covers 31,500 sq. km and is 636 km. long, an average of 48 km wide, and 79.4 km at its widest point. Its water basin occupies about 557,000 sq. km. and contains about 23,000 cu. km. of water, that is, about one fifth of the world's reserves of fresh surface-water and over 80 per cent of the fresh water in the former Soviet Union. Its average depth is 730 m. and its maximum depth in the middle - 1,620 m.\n\nAmong the lake's many habitats are recently discovered hydrothermal vents at a depth of about 400 meters that support sponges, bacterial mats, snails, transparent shrimp, and fish. There are about 2,500 species of known plants and animals in the lake, of which 1,500 are endemic",
    "Local Species": "The water here is crystal clear and pure due to unique underwater reefs of living sponges that filter bacteria and algae from the water, and support a great diversity of fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and other invertebrates.\n\nOxygen circulates to greater depths in Lake Baikal than other lakes, so creatures can survive even in very deep water. The amazing aquatic diversity of the lake includes 147 species of snails, 255 species of shrimp-like amphipod species, and 80 species of flatworm.\n\nSeveral large endemic fish inhabit deeper waters and form part of the prey base of the endemic Baikal seal (Phoca sibirica), the only entirely landlocked seal species in the world. Lake Baikal's fish are distinguished by a \"flock\" of 36 species in the sculpin family Cottidae, an endemic family (Comephoridae), and distinct stocks of Coregonus, Thymallus, and Lota species.",
    "Featured Species": "Baikal seal (Phoca sibirica)\n\nAdult Baikal seals measure 1.2-1.4m in length and weigh 63-70kg, the males slightly larger than the females. Pups normally measure about 65cm in length and weigh about 4kg at birth. Females reach sexual maturity at 3-6 years of age, males at 4-7 years. Baikal seals have been known to dive for as long as 43 minutes. It has been estimated that adult males can live up to 52 years of age, females to 56 years.\n\nThe Baikal seal, one of the world's smallest pinnipeds, is in fact the only pinniped species that lives solely in freshwater. Individuals are also sometimes found wandering up the rivers surrounding the Lake, one seal having been found 400km upstream.\n\nPupping takes place on the Lake Baikal ice from February to March, the pups being born in lairs that have been hollowed out on the fast ice. Baikal seals maintain breathing and haulout holes in the ice, adults usually maintaining one main hole and several auxiliary holes, juveniles usually only a solitary hole.",
    "Threats": "Although industrial development is significant, natural habitats are not as highly fragmented as in other regions of Russia. Major threats stem from industrial pollution, forest clearance, fires, agriculture, and grazing."

Recent studies of the lake bottom suggest that many more species remain to be discovered. About 50 species and subspecies are found nowhere else. These include such animals as the freshwater pearl mussel (Hyrlopsis schlegeri). Other species reach their southern limit in Lake Biwa, where they persist in the cooler temperatures of deep waters. An example of this are a small snail Cincinna biwaensis.\n\nThe coastal areas of the lake are also important wintering areas for waterfowl, with over 50,000 birds arriving in a typical year.",
    "Local Species": "Fish species include Sunayatume (Lampetra mitsukurii), Ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis), Deme-moroko (Squalidus japonica), Rhinogobius similis, and Unagi (Anguilla japonica).\n\nFour of the fishes endemic to this lacustrine system are a Catfish (Silurus biwaensis), Isaza (Chaenogobius isaza), Honmoroko (Opsaiichthys uncirostris), and Gnathopogon caerulescens. Endemic mollusks of the genera Heterogen, Semisulcospira, Radix, Gyraulus, Anodonta, Corbicula, and Pisidium are also present in the lake.",
    "Featured Species": 0,
    "Threats": "The Lake is the largest in Japan and is relied upon to supply water for 14 million people, as well as industrial and other uses within the watershed. Although the lake is located in a protected area, it suffers from threats associated with recreational use, flood-control measures, overfishing, and eutrophication from excessive nutrient inputs. More than one-fourth of the watershed has been converted for paddy field agriculture and conifer plantations.\n\nNorth American bluegills (Lepomis macrochilus) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) have come to dominate the fish community since the 1980s. These top-level predators have profoundly altered the ecosystem of the lake."

Its relatively small Lake Kutubu contains 11 endemic fish species, a phenomenon rarely seen in tropical lakes outside of those in the Rift Valley of Africa.\n\nIt plays such a big role in maintaining the Earth's natural diversity that in 1998 it was declared a Wetland of International Importance. As for Lake Sentani, besides having its own species of rainbowfish, it is also home to another unique species called the Sentani gudgeon. Invertebrates are poorly known for this ecoregion.\n\nLake Kutubu lies in the heart of the Kikori Basin, a vast area of wetlands, grasslands, and rain forest. Its water is clear, still, and about 230 feet (70 meters) deep. The Kikori Basin is home to the world's longest lizard, largest egg-laying mammal (the echidna), largest pigeon, largest moth, and second-largest butterfly.",

    "Featured Species": "Echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus)\n\nEchidnas are toothless and feed almost exclusively on ants and termites. They expose termite galleries by breaking open nests with their strong forepaws or snout or by digging into soil. They then extract the termites, which adhere to their long, sticky tongues. When disturbed, the echidna either curls into a spiny ball to protect its soft underside, or digs its belly into the soil, so that only the spines are exposed.\n\nLong spines cover the body and fur is present between them. These slow-moving creatures have a bulbous forehead and a long snout to collect their food. Males have a spur on the ankle of the hind leg but, unlike that of the platypus, it is not venomous. They are equipped with a long sticky tongue that extends perhaps 17 centimetres beyond the end of the snout.\n\nThis unusual mammal lays eggs and suckles its young. The echidna does not have teats, the baby clings to specialised hairs within the pouch, where it suckles milk oozing from the mother's mammary glands.",
    "Threats": "Lake Kutubu is threatened by over fishing and oil developments nearby, with associated road-building activities and potential for oil spills. Introduced fish species could be very harmful to the endemic species found in these lakes."

The second largest, Lake Lanao, is 2,296 feet (700 m) high in the mountains, and several rivers feed its deep basin, which supports a very productive fishery, as well as a unique group of fish found only here. The streams and lakes of the Philippines freshwater ecoregion support high numbers of endemic species, particularly fish.\n\nThe seven thousand islands with more than 21,000 miles of shoreline, numerous rivers, swamps, and unique mountain lakes - harbour fish and freshwater crab species that evolved over thousands of years from marine ancestors to fill new habitats and conditions over time. For example, the Taal herring, found in Taal Lake, is a sardine that has adapted to live in a freshwater environment.",
    "Local Species": "This ecoregion was home to 30 endemic fish species, including a radiation of 18 endemic cyprinid species in Lake Lanao - all thought to have evolved from the spotted barb.\n\nThe vast majority of the fish species that inhabit the fresh waters of the Philippines (234 out of a total of 330) return to the sea to spawn. Endemic species such as Puntius lindug, P. baoulan, and P. tumba have been driven to the brink of extinction by introduced species. \n\nThis ecoregion also supports disjunct populations of the highly endangered Philippine crocodile (Crocodylus mindorensis) along with 41 endemic freshwater crab species.\n\nThis ecoregion is also home to 41 freshwater crab species, all of which evolved here and are found only here",
    "Featured Species": "Philippine crocodile (Crocodylus mindorensis)\n\nThe Philippine crocodile is a relatively small species - males generally do not grow larger than 3 metres, with females being smaller. Has a relatively broad snout for a crocodile, and heavy dorsal armour.

The number of scales between the orbit and the preopercular angle is 5 or 6; the number between the dorsal and the tip of the snout is 13 to 15. The ventral is less than half the length of the pectoral.\n\nA largest specimen (frorn the Inlé Lake) was found to be 22.6 cm long, and from all accounts the species does not grow more than 25 cm long. This species is abundant all over Yawnghwe and the neighbouring states. It lives on a muddy bottom in sluggish streams and also in all parts of the Inlé Lake, hiding itself as a rule among weeds. Large numbers are sold in the local markets.",
    "Threats": "The Lake has been drastically modified through land reclamation. Floating gardens have been constructed within the lake, and the consequent runoff of pesticides and fertilizer from these lands pollute the lake.\n\nSedimentation from cattle grazing and sewage disposal from surrounding lands adds to the problems. Lake Inle's health has been degraded by a wide range of conditions including cattle grazing; pesticide, fertilizer and sewage runoff; and extensive alteration of the lakebed.

These plateau lakes support some of the most diverse freshwater ecosystems in the entire country. For example, both Dianchi and Er Hai contain rich fish faunas and despite their location in separate river basins (Yangtze and Mekong, respectively), taxonomic similarities exceed differences.",
    "Local Species": "Dianchi historically supported 25 native fish species of which 11 are endemic (all but 2 are apparently extinct), and Er Hai supported 17 native fish species of which 9 are endemic.

Unique species found in this ecoregion include the Yunnan firebelly newt, Shanjing crocodile newt, and the Bubble fish (the fish that inflates itself with air as a defense against predators).\n\nOther species of interest include the Chinese giant salamander (largest salamander in the world, lives only in China and can grow to be more than 63 inches long), and the Ailao spiny toad that has 10 to16 large black spines sticking out from its upper lip, and because of this locals call it \"the mustached frog.\" Numerous endemic fish species in the genera Cyprinus, Schizothorax, Anabarilius, and Yunnanilus occur in this ecoregion. Several lakes historically contained faunas with over half their fish species endemic.",
    "Featured Species": "Chinese giant salamander\n\nThese giant salamanders are about 55 pounds and five feet long. Brown and black skin helps them blend in with the mud, stones, and plants of the streambeds where they live. Their broad, flattened bodies are streamlined for swimming at the bottom of fast-moving water. \n\nGiant salamanders are covered in mucus, which protects their bodies from abrasions and parasites. When irritated or grasped, they produce a milky, sticky secretion that smells like Japanese peppers. The giant salamander absorbs oxygen through its skin. Loose folds of skin along its sides increase surface area to help absorb even more oxygen.\n\nWith their tiny eyes, giant salamanders have poor vision. Instead, they rely on their other senses—such as sensory organs along their bodies and on their heads—to detect other animals and find their way. They eat almost anything they can, from insects to fish to mice to small invertebrates like crabs. Giant salamanders have a very slow metabolism, and go weeks without eating, if necessary.",
    "Threats": "These lakes are found in one of only two remaining subtropical forests in China on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. Threats come from deforestation and destruction of habitat, silt and fertiliser runoff from intensive rice agriculture, pollution, human and industrial waste disposal, aquaculture, and fisheries. Lake Dianchi, which has lost most of its endemic fish species, is an example of a lake that has suffered heavily from sewage, industrial pollutants, and introduced species."

They also feed on mosquito larvae, helping to keep the mosquito population in check. \n\nAmong the endemic invertebrates, which are found predominantly in spring-fed habitats, are a number of aquatic snails and amphipods such as the Pecos assiminea (Assiminea sp.), Phantom Spring cochliopa (Cochliopa texana), Phantom Lake tryonia (Tryonia cheatumi), Phantom Spring amphipod (Gammarus hyalelloides), San Solomon amphipod (G. sp.), and Noel's amphipod (G. desperatus).",
    "Featured Species": "Devil's River minnow (Dionda diaboli)\n\nThe Devils River minnow is a small fish, with adults reaching sizes of approximately 2 inches in length. The fish has a wedge-shaped caudal (near the tail) spot and pronounced lateral stripe extending through the eye to the snout. Double dash markings extend along the lateral line. The species has a narrow head and a body with prominent dark markings.\n\nThe minnow is found in channels of fast-flowing, spring-fed waters over gravel substrates the fish most often occurs where spring flow enters a stream, rather than in the spring outflow itself. Little information is available on life history characteristics, feeding patterns, or reproductive behaviors of this species. However, based on their long coiled intestinal tract, species of the genus Dionda are considered to feed primarily on algae.",
    "Threats": "Water withdrawals as a result of population growth and agricultural activities, leads to the loss of critical habitat in this water-poor environment. Overgrazing, introduced species (e.g., cichlid Hemichromis guttatus and the crayfish Procambarus clarkii), potential large-scale tourism, mining, and pollution also threaten many freshwater communities.\n\nCoordinated efforts of public and private organizations in both Mexico and the United States is leading to a broader understanding of the Chihuahuan Desert and the threats to its ecosystems. With this understanding will come a greater appreciation of the desert and new ways of addressing human needs while maintaining the biodiversity characteristic of the Chihuahuan Desert."

    "Featured Species": "Great bustard (Otis tarda)\n\nThe male of this huge bird is possibly the heaviest extant bird capable of flight. An adult male is normally 1.1 meters (3.7 feet) long with a 2.4 meter (7.9 foot) wingspan and an average weight of 13.5 kg (30 lb). The female is 30% smaller and half the weight, averaging 6.5 kg (14.3 lb).\n\nThe Great bustards breed in March, and a single male may mate with up to 5 females. This species is omnivorous, taking seeds, insects and other small creatures, including frogs and beetles. Great bustards typically live for around 10 years, but some have been known to live up to 15 years or more.\n\nThis bird's habitat is open grassland, although it can be found on undisturbed cultivation. It has a stately slow walk, and tends to run when disturbed rather than fly. It is gregarious, especially in winter.",
    "Threats": "Habitat loss, excessive water diversions, pollution from industry, agriculture, and domestic sources, overfishing, draining of wetlands for malarial control, dams, and introduced species (particularly Zander - Stizostedion lucioperca) are the principle threats to this ecoregion."

    "About the Area": "Antarctic Peninsula & Weddell Sea make up the most diverse and productive Antarctic marine ecosystem. In the Antarctic Peninsula , the southern summer large ice-free areas provide breeding grounds for very large numbers of seabirds and seals.\n\nThe Weddell Sea is part of the Southern Ocean. Much of the southern part of the sea, up to Elephant Island, is permanent ice, the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf. At its widest the sea is around 2,000 km across, in area it is around 2.8 million km².\n\nThe Weddell Sea supports a rich marine ecosystem, where huge quantities of krill (tiny shrimp-like animals) provide food for diverse populations of fish and marine mammals. It also supports thriving colonies of penguins that lay their eggs and raise their young on the Antarctic Peninsula.",
    "Local Species": "Over 200 species of fish from various groups are known to live in Antarctica, many of which are endemic. Most of these belong to the Notothenioidei suborder and include the families of Nototheniidae, Harpagiferidae, Artedidraconidae, Bathydraconidae, and Channichthyidae or the \"bloodless fishes\". \n\nOther species include King penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus), Emperor penguin (A. forsteri), Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii), Crabeater seal (Lobodon carcinophagus), Humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), Southern right whale (Eubalaena australis), Minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), and Hourglass dolphin (Lagenorhynchus cruciger).",
    "Featured Species": "Weddell Seal (Leptonychotes weddellii)\n\nWeddell Seals are known for their very deep dives -- which may reach some 700 meters. They can also hold their breath for approximately 80 minutes. They are not very social out of water, even avoiding physical contact at most times. \n\nCopulation has only been observed to occur underwater, where the female is often bitten in the neck by her partner. Play fighting is very common for these animals as they grow. The diet of the Weddell Seal consists of squids, notothenid fishes, as well as Antarctic toothfish. This seal lives further south than any other mammal, inhabiting the waters of McMurdo Sound, 800 miles from the South Pole. These relatively meek animals are usually found in large groups on ice attached to the continent and can be easily approached by humans",
    "Threats": "The future of Antarctica is crucial to the climate and ecology of the world. Overfishing, global warming, the weakening of the ozone layer, and pollution pose the greatest threats to the region.\n\nWarmer temperatures have cleared a tiny patch of bare ground at the Peninsula's tip. Numerous icebergs are breaking out of the sea ice in the Southern Ocean surrounding the Antarctic Peninsula. Icebergs leaving the Weddell Sea are likely to be moved north and east by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current."

    "About the Area": "The Barents-Kara Sea ecoregion is one of the northernmost bodies of water that does not freeze over during the winter.\n\nCompared to neighboring Arctic seas, the Barents-Kara is shallow and free of ice all through the year due to warm Ocean currents from the North Atlantic and high salt levels.\n\nThese waters are highly productive, allowing inland tundra to be occupied by breeding seabirds as nesting colonies of migrating seabirds abound. Abundant marine mammal populations occur in this ecoregion and it includes the Franz-Josef-Land nature reserve - the largest marine protected area on the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nThe Ecoregion supports abundant fish stocks as well as huge concentrations of nesting seabirds (estimated 16 million birds in early 1990's) and a diverse community of sea mammals (sixteen whale species and seven species of seals recorded).",
    "Local Species": "Birds include little Auk (Alle alle), Barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis), Pink-footed goose (Anser brachyrhynchus), Sabine's gull (Xema sabini), and White-billed diver (Gavia adamsii).\n\nOther important species include the Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida), Flatfish (Order, Pleuronectiformes), Smelt (Family, Osmeridae), Polar bear (Ursus maritimus), Bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus), Walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), and Narwhal (Monodon monoceros).",
    "Featured Species": "Barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis)\n\nIt is a medium-sized goose with a white face and black head, neck, and upper breast. Its belly is white. The wings and its back are silver-gray with black-and-white bars. During flight a V-shaped white rump patch and the silver-gray underwing linings are visible. It is smaller than the Canada Goose with more silvery grey wings and mantle. It looks as though it has pulled a big black stocking over its head and neck but its white face has poked through the toes. Its habitat is winters on coastal grassland pastures and marshes. It breeds on islands in the Baltic.\n\nThey frequently build their nests high on mountain cliffs; away from predators. Instead of bringing food to the newly hatched goslings, the goslings are brought to the ground. Unable to fly, the three day old goslings jump off the cliff and fall; their small size and very light weight protects them from serious injury when they hit the ground. They are then led by the parents to nearby wetland feeding areas.",
    "Threats": "Overfishing and oil and gas development pose severe threats to the ecoregion. The dumping of radioactive materials has killed millions of fish, porpoises, sea stars, shellfish, and seals.\n\nMassive harvests of various species of whales and seals commenced already in the early 1600's. Technological limitations ensured that fisheries did not have significant impacts on the Barents Sea Ecosystem until recently, but after the small-scale coastal fisheries evolved into large-scale offshore fisheries, the fish stocks of the Barents Sea has collapsed several times.\n\nThe ecoregion is still relatively clean compared to oceans in lower latitudes, but the problem of persistent organic pollutants has been addressed on several occasions. NW Russia is the most industrialised region in the arctic, and is the most important regional source of pollution to the Barents Sea."

It covers an area, including the Sea of Marmara but excluding the Black Sea, of about 970,000 square miles. The Mediterranean Sea has significant endemism and is biologically distinctive from the adjacent Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIts rocky reefs, seagrass meadows, and upwelling areas are particularly important habitats that support enormous biodiversity. Seagrass meadows provide important habitat, especially as breeding, feeding, and resting areas for numerous marine species, particularly fish, crustaceans, and marine turtles.\n\nThese meadows produce more than 80% of the annual fish yield in the Mediterranean. The grasses also stabilise the seashore and maintain water quality, particularly through oxygen production. The rocky reef ecosystems provide habitat for the endangered Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus) as well as several endemic fish and invertebrates. The Ligurian Sea represents the most significant upwelling area in the Mediterranean.",

Females are slightly smaller, weighing approximately 300kg. Adults are generally brown or grey on the back, and lighter on the belly. A white patch is common on the underside of the belly, and other irregular light patches are not uncommon. Older males tend to be black. Pups are born from 88-103cm in length and weigh 16-18kg.\n\nMales and females are thought to reach sexual maturity between 5 and 6 years, although some females may mature as early as 4 years. Pups are born over much of the year although peak pupping occurs in September and October. Monk seal pups can swim and dive at about two weeks of age and are weaned at about 16-17 weeks. Monk seals are thought to forage in nearshore waters for fish and octopus. Individuals may live for 20-30 years in the wild.",
    "Threats": "In the Mediterranan Sea marine life is heavily threatened by habitat degradation mostly due to human activities, such as fisheries, ship traffic, water pollution, coastal anthropization.\n\nThe cetacean population are currently affected by heavy pollution which contaminates the marine food web, by overexploitation of marine resources due to unsustainable and not selective fishery, and also by direct and indirect take of cetaceans.\n\nCoastal development, intensive tourism, and land reclamation for agriculture place pressures on key wildlife habitats in the Mediterranean. Local and regional problems related to pollution, specifically effluents from domestic and industrial sources, oil transportation and refineries, and agricultural runoff, are beginning to have an impact on wildlife.\n\nAdditionally, intense development, sand excavation, urbanisation, and the release of untreated sewage into the sea is a major public health issue, as increased numbers of microorganisms have led to an increase in several diseases. The fisheries of this region have been overexploited and many local fisheries are declining as a consequence of indiscriminate trawl fishing and high levels of bycatch."

Several other penguins can be seen in these waters including Snares penguin (Eudyptes robustus), Little penguin (Eudyptula minor), and Fiordland crested penguin (Eudyptes pachyrhynchus).\n\nA few of the other birds are the Shy albatross (Diomedea cauta), Royal albatross (D. epomophora), Northern giant petrel (Macronectes halli), Southern giant petrel (M. giganteus), and the Australasian gannet (Sula serrator).\n\nMarine mammals include Southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina), New Zealand fur seal (Arctocephalus forsteri), Hooker's sea lion (Phocarctos hookeri), Dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), Hector's dolphin (Cephalorynchus hectori), Sperm whale (Physeter catodon), and the Southern right whale (Eubalaena australis).",
    "Featured Species": "NONE",
    "Threats": "Overfishing, sewage discharge, industrial contaminants, agricultural runoff, habitat clearance for construction (residential and tourist), mining residues, oil exploitation and associated pollution, inappropriate coastal development, and solid waste disposal are all real threats. \n\nIn some areas, introduced cats and rats have destroyed colonies of native shorebird species (e.g., Kermadec petrel, Pterodroma neglecta)."

    "Name": "Californian Current",
    "Size": "N/A",
    "Habitat Type": "Temperate Upwelling",
    "Geographic Location": "Northeastern temperate Pacific Ocean along the coast of temperate North America",
    "Conservation Status": "Relatively Stable/Intact",
    "About the Area": "The Californian Current helps create highly diverse and productive upwelling ecosystems in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The area off the coast of California and Oregon is home to huge populations of marine mammals, seabirds, and fish. It is best known for its extensive kelp forests and Sea otters (Enhydra lutris).",
    "Local Species": "Species include Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), Yellowfin sole (Limanda aspera), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), California skate (Raja inornata), Shovelnose guitarfish (Rhinobatos productus), Longfin gunnel (Pholis clemensi), numerous species of anadromous (those that migrate from freshwater to the ocean and back to freshwater) salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), and great white sharks (Carcharodon spp.).\nGiant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) provides important habitat for numerous other species. The burrowing starlet sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis) is just one of many important invertebrates.\n\nNumerous marine mammals are found here, including Sea otter (Enhydra lutris), Northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris), California sea lion (Zalophus californianus), Northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus), Guadalupe fur seal (Arctocephalus townsendii), Steller's sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus), Grey whale (Eschrichtius robustus), and Harbor seal (Phoca vitulina).\n\nOther species include Pacific green turtle (Chelonia agassizii), Olive ridley turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea), Loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta), Leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), Townsend's shearwater (Puffinus auricularis), Ashy storm-petrel (Oceanodroma homochroa), Heerman's gull (Larus heermanni), Xantu's murrelet (Synthliboramphus hypoleucus), and Brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis). Cetaceans include Pilot whale (Globicephala maerorynchus), Killer whale (Orcinus orca), and Northern right whale (Eubalaena glacialis).",
    "Featured Species": "NONE",
    "Threats": "Regional coastal waters have become polluted, especially near major cities, leading to problems of contaminated seafood. Other major threats to the region come from oil shipping accidents and overfishing."

    "Name": "Benguela Current",
    "Size": "N/A",
    "Habitat Type": "Temperate Upwelling",
    "Geographic Location": "Southeastern Atlantic Ocean near the southwestern coast of Africa",
    "Conservation Status": "Vulnerable",
    "About the Area": "The Benguela Current flows north along the west coast of South Africa and Namibia. In the south it meets the warmer Aghulhas Current flowing east from the Indian Ocean and in the north it interacts with the warmer Angolan current flowing south.\nThis co-mingling of warm and cold currents causes highly productive upwellings - ideal thriving conditions for populations of fish, seabirds and marine mammals, also providing shelter to important migratory bird populations in coastal lagoons and bays.",
    "Local Species": "Selected species include the Jackass penguin (Spheniscus demersus) , Disk lamp shell (Discinisca tenuis), Rock lobster (Jasus lalandii), Pilchard (Sardinops ocellatus), Cape horse mackerel (Trachurus capensis), Hake (Merluccius capensis), Cape fur seal (Artocephalus pusillus), Southern right whale (Eubalaena australis), and the rare Heaviside's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus heavisidei).",
    "Featured Species": "NONE",
    "Threats": "Persistent overharvesting of many commercially valuable species and products (e.g., pilchard, anchovy, rock lobster, and seabird guano) and industrial harbour development, especially in Walvis Bay, pose some real threats"
