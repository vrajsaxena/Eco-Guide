As it swims on its side, it trails a flipper along the bottom of the river. After 30 to 60 seconds, when it needs to breath, it swims to the surface, rotates upright to take in the air, and then rotates thorough 90 degrees again as it swims back to the bottom.\n\nNumbers have dramatically declined since the construction of the irrigation system in the Indus.

However, Amami rabbits are noted for making calling noises, which sound similar to a pika; this makes them unique as most rabbits do not make calling noises.\n\nIsland residents introduced the mongoose to these islands in an attempt to control the population of poisonous snakes.

Also found here are the Giant forest hog (Hylochoerus meinertzhageni), Bongo (Tragelaphus euryceros), and the Beecroft''s tree hyrax (Dendrohyrax dorsalis).\n\nAmongst the bird species found here are the Forest swallow (Hirundo fuliginosa), the River warbler (Bradypterus grandis), Bates''s weaver (Ploceus batesi), and the African river martin (Pseudochelidon eurystomina). There is one near-endemic amphibian, the Yambata River Frog (Phrynobatrachus giorgii), and three near-endemic reptiles: gray chameleon (Chamaeleo chapini), Witte''s beaked snake (Rhinotyphlops wittei), and Gastropholis tropidopholis.\n\nThere are an estimated 7,151 vascular plants found in Gabon, over 3,600 in the Central African Republic, 8,260 in Cameroon, and 6,000 in Congo.', 'Giant Forest Hog\n\nThe Giant Forest Hog (Hylochoerus meinertzhageni) is the largest wild member of the pig family Suidae. Males can reach as much as 2 m in length and 110 centimeters high at the shoulder and have been known to weigh as much as 225 kg.\n\nIt is mostly black in color on the surface, though hairs nearest the skin of the animal are a deep orange color. Its ears are large and pointy, and its tusks are much smaller than those of the warthog or bushpig. This nocturnal species is herbivorous and does not dig for food with its snout like other wild pigs do.\n\nThough known to native peoples of tropical African forests for many millennia and subject in many of these cultures to various taboos and superstitions, giant forest hogs were not known to Western science until 1904.', 'While the forests of this ecoregion are relatively intact, increasing logging activity and clearing for agriculture threaten them. Ravaged by commercial interests (Ivory, skins, rubber and slaves) for about 100 years, the indigenous people have been deeply affected by these events. Organized hunting of the larger species for bushmeat, elephants for ivory and meat, and gorillas for meat and fetishes threatens animal populations in the region. Closer to the Congo and Ubangui Rivers, poaching has probably already eliminated elephants.'),
('Western Himalayan Temperate Forests', '95,500 sq. km (37,000 sq. miles)', 'Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests', 'India, Nepal, Pakistan', 'Critical/Endangered', 'This Global ecoregion is made up of 2 terrestrial ecoregions: Western Himalayan broadleaf forests; and Western Himalayan subalpine conifer forests.\n\nSome of the world''s richest temperate montane plant communities, including the best example of south temperate montane forests in southern Asia occur in this region. Due to the continental climate and a Mediterranean influence to temper the effects of the south asian monsoon, this region is floristically quite distinct from the eastern Himalayas.\n\nThe temperate forests of this ecoregion grow at elevations of 600 to 3,800 metres (1,980 to 12,540 ft) along the western slopes of the Himalayas. The middle elevation forests of the Western Himalayas, including places such as the Palas Valley of Pakistan - the most floristically rich area in Pakistan, contain numerous plant species found nowhere else on Earth.', 'Characteristic plant species in the region include conifers Blue pine (Pinus wallichiana), Spruce (Picea smithiana), Yew (Taxus wallichiana), and Fir (Abies pindrow); subalpine broadleaved species such as Birch (Betula utilis) and Rhododendron (Rhododendron campanulatum); and endangered endemic plant species such as shrubs Lactuca undulata and Berberis lambertii.\n\nPakistan''s Palas Valley is home to some of the world''s last populations of western tragopans, a species of arboreal pheasant. Mammals include the endangered snow leopard (Uncia uncia) - severely threatened in this region by hunting, Bengal tigers, Himalayan tahrs, and the blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) that are hunted at night by the snow leopards. Among the many birds are snow geese, Tibetan sand grouse, Himalayan griffons, and rubythroats.\n\nMore than 300 species of birds live in the Broadleaf forests, ranging from warblers to pheasants. 7 species of birds are found here and almost nowhere else in the world: the white-cheeked tit, white-throated tit, spectacled finch, Kashmir flycatcher, Tyler’s leaf-warbler, orange bullfinch, and Kashmir nuthatch. More than 70 other species of mammals live here too.', 'Himalayan tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus)\n\nThe Tahr’s body length is about 90-140 cm and it weighs 36-90 kg. The dense, woolly winter coat is reddish to dark brown and has a thick undercoat. With their winter coat, males also grow a long, shaggy mane around the neck and shoulders which extends down the front legs. After the spring moult, the coat is much shorter and lighter in color. The legs are relatively short, and the head is proportionally small. The eyes are large, and the ears are small and pointed. The horns are triangular in cross-section and are found in both sexes. They curve upward, backwards, and then inwards, to a maximum length of 45 cm, and are usually larger in males.\n\nMost active during the early morning and late afternoon, Himalayan tahrs spend the middle of the day resting among rocks and vegetation. Very shy and wary, they are difficult to approach, especially from downhill. When startled, they flee with confidence, speeding sure-footedly across the uneven terrain of their habitat. The Himalayan tahr may migrate down the mountain during the winter, resting in denser cover at lower altitudes. When competing for breeding privileges, males lock horns and attempt to throw each other off balance.\n\nThey are listed as vulnerable by IUCN. ', 'The remaining forests of this ecoregion are threatened by increasing logging, conversion of land to agriculture, and fuel collection. Hunting is a popular activity in Pakistan and many people own guns. In addition, people from around the world flock here as pilgrims or tourists. Their presence has spurred ill-planned roads, trails, and hotels. Large-scale collection of the morel mushroom (Morchella esculenta) from the Alpine forests by the local people for export coincides with the breeding season of several pheasants and high altitude mammals'),
('Western Java Mountain Forests ', '6,200 sq. km (2,400 sq. miles)', 'Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests', 'Java, a large island in Indonesia', 'Critical/Endangered', 'The Western Java Mountain Forests harbour a diversity of habitats, which in turn gives way to a rich variety of flora and fauna, with many endemic species. Endemism is highest for mammals, but is also significant for birds.\n\nWith many mountains and with a rainfall amounting to 3 m (10 ft) per annum in some places, the Java island has, as might be expected, an abundance of springs and running streams, and these make possible a very perfect system of irrigation which has converted it into ''a vast garden’.\n\nNearly all of the original forest has been cleared to make way for Java''s dense and expanding population. Nonetheless, rain forests and river habitats remain in a few parks and contribute to the region''s great biodiversity.', 'These forests contain many species now virtually extinct elsewhere in Java, including trees such as Elaeocarpus macrocerus, Alstonia spathulata, Wild mango (Mangifera gedebe), Stemonurus secundiflora, and a huge sedge (Thoracostachyrum sumatrana).\n\nBesides the globally threatened surili leaf monkey (Presbytis comata), the endemic Javan gibbon (Hylobates moloch) lives here too.\n\nCharacteristic of the bird fauna are species such as the endemic Javan tesia (Tesia superciliaris), green spectacled pigeon (Treron oxyura), and the Sunda thrush (Zoothera andromedae).', 'The surili leaf monkey (Presbytis comata) is a small, slim built primate. Its fur at the top is brown, grey or black and at the lower surface whitish, sometimes also orange, with some species having fur designs at the head or at the hips. Its German name, meaning ‘capped langur’, comes from the hair on its head, which forms a tuft. It ranges in adult length from 40 to 60 cm (with a 50 to 85 cm long tail) and a weight of 5 to 8 kg.\n\nA diurnal forest dweller, it spends nearly all its life in the trees. It lives predominantly in groups of 6 to 8 animals consisting of a male, several females, and their young. More recently it has been observed in monogamous pairings (particularly the Mentawai Langur), although this might be a reaction to the decrease of their habitat. The groups are hierarchically developed, with intergroup communication that is both vocal and postural.\n\nThe surilis'' diet consists of leaves, fruits, and seeds. Its life expectancy is estimated at 20 years.', 'Only 5% of the original habitat remains in this ecoregion, as it is located on the most densely populated island in Indonesia. Erosion and burning pose serious threats to the fragments that remain.'),
('Xi Jiang Rivers and Streams', '387,000 sq. km (154,800 sq. miles)', 'Small Rivers', 'Southeastern Asia: southern China and northern Vietnam', 'Critical/Endangered', 'The southern margin of China is characterised by a distinctive landscape of karst limestone, where hills, sinkholes, and caverns abound. As the second largest river system in China, the Xi Jiang (or Pearl River) has three main tributaries: the Xi Jiang, the Beijang, and the Dongjiang. The Xi Jiang is by far the largest of the three. The Xi Jiang runs for more than 1,300 miles (2,000 km) before flowing through the vast Pearl Delta and into the South China Sea.\n\nThe endemic diversity is considered unusual for a moderate climate. Each summer monsoonal rains flood the Xi Jiang River, the level of flooding varies each year depending on the strength of the monsoons.', 'The ecoregion, defined by the Xi Jiang (or Pearl River) and its tributaries, contains over 380 freshwater, brackish, and anadromous fish species out of which, 120 may be endemic.\n\nThis ecoregion''s migratory fish species include the rare Chinese sturgeon (Acipenser sinensis) and two Shads (Tenualosa reevesii and Clupanodon thrissa).', 'The Chinese sturgeon (Acipenser sinensis) is an anadromous protected species that presently only spawns in the Yangtze River. Its size is about 130 cm. The max. weight is about 550.0 kg. Fry can be found in slow moving waters and the adults in deep waters. \n\nThe fish is used in Chinese medicine. Little is currently known about the population genetic structure of the Chinese sturgeon. The max. reported age is 13 years.', 'The natural population of the rare Chinese sturgeon has declined since the Gezhouba Dam blocked its migratory route to the spawning grounds in 1981. In the near future, the completion of the Three Gorges Dam, the world''s largest hydroelectric project, may further impact this species by altering the water flow of the Yangtze River. \n\nOver 3,000 dams have been built on the Xi Jiang River and its tributaries, blocking the migration of freshwater and anadromous species. Over seventy-five per cent of land in the basin has been converted into cropland resulting in the loss of eighty per cent of the original forest cover.\n\nThus, the landscape around the rivers and streams has been severely changed, leaving little of the natural vegetation to buffer water flowing overland to the streams, further resulting in water pollution. Population in the delta of this river is expected to double over the next 25-50 years, and with an increasing population will come an increasing need for clean fresh water.'),
('Yangtze River and Lakes', '1,613,378 sq. km (622,925 sq. miles)', 'Large Rivers', 'Asia - flowing west to east through China', 'Critical/Endangered', 'From an elevation of 4,900 meters (about 16,000 feet), the third longest river in the world - Yangtze, descends rapidly as it crosses gorges and runs past limestone hills. Today, the Yangtze (known locally as Chang Jiang, or "Long River") is a centre for agriculture, industry, and tourism.\nThe river and the lakes that it feeds are also where diverse species of fish, birds, and mammals have lived for centuries. During the summer rainy season, swollen waters of the Yangtze River flood into the surrounding lake basins; during winter and spring when river levels are low, the lakes drain back into the river.\n\nThe flora and fauna are adapted to these cycles as fish mix freely between lakes during flooding and terrestrial mammals swim to seek high ground. Poyang Lake, one of the largest lakes, serves as winter habitat for numerous waterfowl species.', 'The Yangtze river dolphin, or baiji, was once well-known along much of the central and lower Yangtze. However, rapid development in the Yangtze basin, which is home to more than 400 million people, has put immense pressure on the river''s ecosystem and its unique biodiversity. Today, the baiji is functionally extinct. \n\nConservation efforts were too late to save the baiji; to avoid a repeat of this tragedy, serious efforts are underway to protect the Yangtze finless porpoise, which numbers between 1,200 and 1,800 in the basin. \n\nAmong the numerous threatened fish species are the Yangtze sturgeon (Acipenser dabryanus), Chinese sturgeon (A. sinensis), and the Chinese swordfish (Psephurus gladius). Other vertebrates include the largest salamander in the world, Audrias davidianus, Red-crowned crane (Grus japonensis), and the highly endangered Yangtze alligator (Alligator sinensis).\n', '', 'Fish farming, deforestation, cultivation of surrounding land for farming and grazing, pollution, oil drilling, industrialisation, urbanisation, and introduced diseases from domestic waterfowl pose widespread threats to this ecoregion. The most pressing and severe threat is construction of dams and dikes on the Yangtze and its tributaries, which alter the natural flow regime, block migratory routes, and sever the connection between the rivers and their floodplain habitats.'),

Common inhabitants of the floodplains of southern Africa are the Waterbuck (Kobus ellipsprymnus ellipsprymnus and K. e. defassa), Puku (Kobus vardonii), Lechwe (Kobus leche), Hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius), and the Sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekei).\n\nBird species include the Slaty egret (Egretta vinaceigula), Wattled crane (Grus carunculatus), and the Pygmy goose (Nettapus auritus). Amongst the endemic reptiles are Barotse water snake (Crotaphopeltis barotseensis) and the striped swamp snake (Limnophis bicolor)', '', 'Threats include cattle ranching, and contamination from heavy metals, insecticide and agricultural runoff. The human populations of these wetland areas are generally low, largely due to the high density of disease-carrying organisms such as the malaria mosquitoes, tsetse flies, and aquatic snails that transmit bilharzia.\n\nInsecticide pollution includes DDT used for malaria control in Namibia and a number of less persistent compounds used for tsetse control in Botswana. Water diversions for irrigation and hydroelectric dams have already affected some floodplain systems and are threatening others.\n\nExcess withdraw from the Okavango Riveris, currently being discussed by partner countries, could have deleterious effects on the functioning of the delta ecosystems.');
